المحاكم الجنائية 5    --- Page 2 --- الجزء الأول الحلول النموذجية للقضايا الأكثر شيوعا في الواقع العملي   --- Page 3 --- خصائص النيابة العامة القضية ‎(١)‏  أصدر وزير العدل أمره الى عضو النيابة العامة بعدم إقامة الدعوى الجنانية  بالنسبة الى متهم معين« ومع ذلك قام العضو برفعهاء فما رأيك في هذا الإجراء؟ الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بخاصية التبعية التدريجية كإحدى خصائص النيابة العامة.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر قانونا أن رجال النيابة العامة تابعون لرؤسائهم دون غيرهم بترتيب درجاتهم ثم لوزير العدل )م57 من قانون السلطة القضائية(. فللوزير حق الإشراف والرقابة على أعضاء النيابة العامة للتأكد من قيامهم .بواجباتهم الوظيفية طبقا للقانون.  وتظهر رناسة الوزير الإدارية في تنقلات أعضاء النيابة وتحديد محال إقامتهم واختصاصهم المكاني والنوعي وندبهم من مكان لآخرء علاوة على ما له من توجيه التنبيه لأعضاء النيابة الذين يخلون بواجباتهم بعد سماع أقوال عضو النيابة )م571 من قانون السلطة القضانية(.  كما تظهر سلطة وزير العدل الرناسية على النائب العام الوزير بالقضايا الهامة.  .ولكن ليس لوزير العدل أي إشراف قضاني على أعضاء النيابة العامة. وبناء على ذلك لا يجوز للوزير أن يأمر أحد أعضاء النيابة العامة بالتصرف في الدعوى الجناتية أو عدم التصرف فيها. ولا يترتب على مخالفة أوامر وزير العدل في صدد الدعوى العمومية أي بطلان.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية والأحكام القضانية سالفة الذكر يتضح أن قيام عضو النيابة برفع الدعوى الجنانية الى المحكمة يكون صحيحاء ويتعين على المحكمة قبولهاء لآن رئاسة وزير العدل على أعضاء النيابة رناسة إدارية فحسب لا يترتب عليها أي أثر قانوني.  يلزمه من إحاطة    --- Page 4 --- أمر النائب العام أحد أعضاء |! النيابة« لم يستجب لذلك وأصدر قرارا بأن لا وجه لإقامة الدعوى؛ فما رأيك في هذا الإجراء؟  الإجابة المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق أيضا هذه القضية بخاصية التبعية  : يتبع أعضاء النيابة - عدا نيابة النقض - النائب العام تبعية إدارية. وقضائية. فهو يشرف إداريا على جميع أعضاء النيابة. وهو الأصيل في تحريك ومباشرة الدعوى الجنائية. بمعنى أن باقي أعضاء النيابة يعتبرون وكلاء عنه يستعملون الدعوى باسمه ويستمدون منه سلطاتهم.  ومن أجل ذلك يكون للنائب العام أن يصدر ما يراه من تعليمات الى أعضاء النيابة بشأن إقامة أو مباشرة الدعوى العمومية دون التحقيق فيهاء وأن يأمر بحفظ التحقيق أو بأن لا وجه لاقامة الدعوى العمومية. ويترتب على مخالفة أعضاء النيابة العامة لهذه التعليمات والأوامر بطلان تصرفاتهم؛ لآن في ذلك خروج عن حدود الوكالة الممنوحة لهم من النانب العام؛ فيكون تصرفه صادرا من غير ذي صفة؛ وذلك علاوة على مسنوليته الإدارية.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر فإنه إذا أمر النائب العام أحد أعضاء النيابة برفع الدعوى الجنانية: فقام هذا الأخير بحفظها أو أصدر أمرا بالا وجه فيهاء فإن هذا الأمر الصادر من العضو يكون باطلا.    --- Page 5 --- القضية )7(  اكلفت المحكمة الجنانية عضو النيابة العامة الحاضر في الجلسة بإجراء تحقيق  في دعوى معروضة أمامها. فقامت النيابة العامة بتنفيذ أمر المحكمة؛ وأجرت  التحقيق فيها أثناء سير المحاكمة. وبعد إجراء التحقيق عابت المحكمة على عضو إجرانه لهذا التحقيق. فما رأيك في مسلك المحكمة؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تعلق هذه القضية بخاصية الاستقلال التي تتمتع بها النيابة العامة عن قضاء الحكم بصفة خاصة.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر أنه ولو أن النيابة العامة تعتبر جزءا من السلطة القضانية؛ إلا أن ذلك لا يعني تبعيتها لقضاء الحكم أو خضوعها لإشرافه ورقابته. فالنيابة العامة كسلطة اتهام مستقلة عن قضاء الحكم.  وعلى ذلك لا يجوز للمحكمة أن توجه النيابة العامة الى اتباع إجراءات معينة« أو أن تقوم بدلا عنها بأعمال تدخل في اختصاصها. ولذلك فلا يجوز للمحكمة أن اتكلف النيابة بإجراء تحقيق في دعوى معروضة عليهاء لأنه يترتب على إحالة الدعوى من سلطة التحقيق على قضاء الحكم خروج الدعوى من حوزتها. كما أن إجراء التحقيق النهاني هو واجب محكمة الموضوع, ويتعين على المحكمة إذا تعذر اليل أمامها أن تندب أحد أعضانها لتحقيقه )م51 إجراءات(. ويترتب أيضا على خاصية الاستقلال أنه لا يجوز لمحكمة الموضوع انتقاد تصرفات النيابة العامة.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية والأحكام القضانية سالفة الذكر يتضح أنه إذا استجابت النيابة العامة لأمر المحكمة وأجرت التحقيق في الدعوى أثناء سير المحاكمة؛ فإن هذا التحقيق يكون باطلا لمخالفته لقواعد التنظيم القضاني وهي متعلقة بالنظام العام.    --- Page 6 --- مدى إمكانية رد أعضاء النيابة القضية )4( أثناء إجراء المحاكمة الجنانية لأحد المتهمين طلبت المحكمة من عضو النيابة الحاضر في الجلسة الإدلاء بشهادته عن التحقيقات التي أجريت في شأن الواقعة. وبعد سماع الشهادة طلب المتهم رد عضو النيابة؛ فهل يقبل منه هذا الطلب؟  الإجاب  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بمسألة مدى إمكانية رد أعضاء النيابة العامة من عدمه.  الأسانيد القانونيية : من المقرر أن حضور أعضاء النيا المحاكمة الجنائية يكون باعتبارهم ممثلين لسلطة الإدعاء والاتهام في الدعوى ولا شأن لهم بالحكم فيها. بل أن عضو النيابة هو بمثابة خصم للمتهم؛ والقاعدة هي أنه الا يجوز للخصم أن يرد خصمه؛ ومن ثم لا يجوز رد أعضاء النيابة )م 441/5 .  التطبيق : بتطبيق المبادئ سالفة الذكر على القضية الحالية نجد أن طلب رد عضو النيابة يكون غير مقبول.  إجراءات جنا   --- Page 7 --- القيود التي ترد على حرية النيابة العامة في تحريك الدعوى الجنائية القضية )( اتفق النائب العام مع الرئيس الإداري لأحد الموظفين المتهمين - بارتكاب جريمة اختلاس المال العام على عدم رفع الدعوى الجنانية على هذا المتهم؛ وعلى الرغم من ذلك أمر النائب العام برفعها. فهل يكون هذا الإجراء صحيحا من الناحية القانونية؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تعلق هذه القضية بمسألة القيود التي ترد على حرية النيابة العامة في تجريك الدعوى الجنانية. من المقرر قانونا أن النيابة العامة هي وحدها التي تملك ومع ذلك خرج المشرع الإجراني على هذه القاعدة بأن أورد قيودا تحد من حرية النيابة العامة في هذا الصدد على سبيل الحصر وهي الشكوى والطلب والإذن.  ولما كانت جريمة اختلاس المال العام ليست من بين الجرائم التي يتوقف تحريك الدعوى فيها على شكوى أو طلب أو إذن« فإن اتفاق النانب العام مع الرئيس الإداري للموظف المتهم على عدم رفع الدعوى لا يكون له أي أثر قانوني.  التطبيق : بإنزال الأسانيد القانونية والأحكام القضانية سالفة الذكر على القضية الحالية يمكن القول بأن أمر النائب العام برفع الدعوى الجنانية على الموظف بدون الحصول مقدما على موافقة رئيسه يكون صحيحا قانونا وينتج أثرهء وأن وعد النائب العام بعدم رفعها أو بحفظها يكون عديم الأثر على سير الدعوى.    --- Page 8 --- القضية )5( اتفضي بعض القوانين بأنه يلزم عند القبض أو التحقيق أو التفتيش الذي تباشره النيابة على شخص ينتمي الى نقابة معينة« كالأطباء والمحامين؛ بضرورة إخطار التقيب ليتسنى له حضور التحقيق. فاذا قامت النيابة العامة بمباشرة التحقيق دون القيام بهذا الإخطارء أو دون انتظار النقيب؛ فهل يكون لذلك تأثير قانوني على  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بالقيود الواردة على سلطة النيابة العامة في استعمال الدعوى الجنائية.  الأسانيد القانونية : أن النصوص التي تقضي بوجوب إخطار النقابة أو جهة معينة يتبعها المتهم لا يضفي أي قيد على حقها في مباشرة سلطاتها التي لا يحكمها إلا قانون الإجراءات الجنانية« وهو لا يعدو أن يكون إجراء لتنظيم كيفية التعاون بين هذه الجهات.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية يتضح أن مباشرة. النيابة للتحقيق مع بعض المتهمين دون الإخطار ليس له أي تأثير قانوني على تصرف النيابة الذي يكون صحيحا قانونا.  القضية )0( قدم المجني عليه في جريمة قذف شكوى الى الجهة الإدارية التابع لها المتهم المجازاته إدارياء فقامت النيابة العامة بناء على ذلك برفع الدعوى ال المتهم عن جريمة القذف. فهل يعتبر رفع الدعوى صحيحا من الناحية القانوذ وهل يختلف الحكم لو رفع المجني عليه دعوى تعويض عن هذه الجريمة أمام المحكمة المدنية؟    --- Page 9 --- المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بالجهات التي تقدم إليها الشكوى لرفع القيد الوارد على سلطة النيابة في تحريك الدعوى الجنانية بالنسبة للجرائم التي يتوقف تحريك الدعوى عنها على شكوى من المجني عليه.  الأسانيد القانونية : لأن تقديم الشكوى قد يؤدي الى رفع الدعوى الجنانية فلابد من تقديمها الى من يملك هذا الإجراء. وقد حدد القانون هذه الجهات وهي النيابة العامة ومأموري الضبط القضاني. وبناء على ذلك فإن تقديم الشكوى الى غير هذه الجهات لا يرفع القيد الوارد على سلطة النيابة.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ سالفة الذكر يتضح أن تقديم الشكوى الى الجهة. الإدارية لمجازاة الجاني إداريا لا يعتبر شكوى بالمعنى الذي يقصده قانون الإجراءات الجنانية« ولا يصح بالتالي للنيابة العامة الاستناد إليه لاسترداد حريتها في تحريك الدعوى الجنائية.  ولا يختلف الحكم في حالة رفع الدعوى المدنية على الجاني أمام المحكمة. الا يجوز بمقتضاها رفع الدعوى الجنا: القضية )8(  رفعت النيابة العامة الدعوى الجنانية على زوج بتهمة تزوير عقد بيع سيارة مملوكة لزوجته. دفع الزوج بعدم جواز رفع الدعوى عليه؛ لأن جريمة التزوير ارتكبت لإخفاء جريمة خيانة الأمانة لتبديده السيارة؛ ولم تقدم الزوجة الشكوى  عنهاء قهل يقبل هذا الدفع؟ الإجابة المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية أيضا بموضوع قيود  رفع الدعوى الجنائية في الجرائم التي يلزم فيها شكوى.   --- Page 10 --- كما يتصل حل هذه القضية بحالة ارتباط الجريمة التي يتوقف تحريك الدعوى عنها على شكوى من المجني عليه بجريمة بجريمة أخرى لا تخضع لهذا القيد.  الأسانيد القانونية : يراعى عند حل مثل هذه القضية أن ينظر الى الجريمة ذات الوصف الأشد.  من المقرر قانونا أنه في حالة التعدد المعنوي تكون العبرة بالوصف الأشد. فإذا كانت الجريمة التي يتوقف رفع الدعوى عنها على شكوى هي ذات العقوبة الأشدء فإن ذلك يترتب عليه عدم جواز رفع الدعوى عنها وعن الجريمة ذات الوصف الأخف قبل تقديم الشكوى.  أما اذا كانت الجريمة المتوقفة على تقديم شكوى هي ذات العقوبة الأخف؛ فإن الا يقيد من سلطة النيابة العامة في تحريك الدعوى عن الجريمة ذات الوصف الأشدء دون اشتراط تقديم شكوى من المجني عليه بالنسبة للأولى.  وفي حالة التعدد المادي للجرائم بدون ارتباط فإن النيابة تقوم بتحريك الدعوى عن الجريمة التي لا يلزم فيها شكوى من المجني عليه. أما الجرائم التي تتطلب الشكوى, فلا يجوز للنيابة تحريك الدعوى فيها إلا بعد تفديم الشكوى  وفي حالة التعدد المادي للجرائم مع الارتباط الذي لا يقبل التجزنة فإنها تعتبر جميعا جريمة واحدة ويحكم فيها بالعقوبة المقررة لأشد تلك الجرائم. فاذا كانت هذه الجريمة هي المتوقفة على شكوىء فلا يجوز اتخاذ أي إجراء فيها قبل تقديم الشكوى حتى بالنسبة للجريمة الأخف التي لا يتوقف تحريكها على شكوى. أما اذا كانت الجريمة الأشد لا يلزم لرفعها شكوى؛ فيكون للنيابة مطلق الحرية في تحريك الدعوى عنها دون انتظار تقديم شكوى من المجني عليه.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ السالفة الذكر على وقانع الدعوى الحالية يتضح أن الزوج ارتكب تزويرا في المستندات الخاصة بزوجته لإخفاء تبديد السيارة؛ فهو فعل واحد ينطوي على جريمتين : تزوير المستندات وتبديد أموال الزوجة باعتباره    --- Page 11 --- من جرائم الأموال. والجريمة الأولى لا تتوقف على شكوى؛ في حين أن الجريمة الثانية تخضع لقيد الشكوى.  ولما كانت جريمة التزوير هي الجريمة الأشد فإن النيابة تسترد كامل حريتها في تحريك الدعوى الجنائية عنهاء وبالتالي يكون دفع المتهم غير مقبول.  القضية )4( )أ( جريمة سب ضد )ب(« وتوفى هذا الأخير قبل تقديم الشكوى. فقام د أبنائه بتقديم شكوى الى النيابة العامة طالبا رفع الدعوى الجنانية على )أ( ند في ذلك الى سببين : الأول أنه قد لحقه ضرر من جراء جريمة السب الموجهة الى والده والثاني؛ أن والده لم يتقدم بالشكوى؛ ومن ثم فإن هذا الحق قد انتقل إليه بالميراث. فهل تقبل منه الشكوى؟ وهل يسقط هذا الحق إذا تبين أن المجني عليه قد تقدم بشكواه قبل وفاته؟  الإجاب  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية الذين لهم الحق في تقديم الشكوى.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر قانونا أنه لا يجوز رفع الدعوى الجنانية إلا بناء على شكوى شفوية أو كتابية من المجني عليه أو من وكيله الخاص )م 5 إجراءات جنائية(.  فصاحب الحق الأصيل في تقديم الشكوى إذن هو المجني عليه فحسب. كما أجاز القانون للمجني عليه تقديم الشكوى بواسطة وكيل عنه؛ بشرط أن يكون التوكيل خاصا ومتعلقا بواقعة معينة سابقة على صدوره.  لق هذه القضية بتحديد الأشخاص  ومن المقرر أيضا أن الحق في الشكوى ذو طبيعة شخصية بحتة« ولذا فهو ينقضي بوفاة المجني عليه« ومن ثم فلا ينتقل هذا الحق الى الورثة مهما كان الضرر الذي أصابهم من جراء الجريمة« حتى ولو تبين أن المورث لم يكن يعلم بالجريمة أو كان لا يعرف مرتكبها.   --- Page 12 --- ومن المقرر كذلك أنه اذا تقدم المجني عليه ما بشكوى فإنه لا أثر لوفاته على اسير الدعوى بعد تقديمهاء ولو اتضح أن المجني عليه كان مزمعا التنازل عنها. فالدعوى تستمر الدعوى لأنها لا تنقضي بوفاة المجني عليه.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية السابقة نجد أن الدعوى تكون غير مقبولة. الأن الحق في

الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير هذه القضية موضوع الإدعاء المباشر ومدى قبوله في حالة تولي النيابة العامة التحقيق؛ أو إصدارها أمرا بحفظ الأوراق؛ أو بألا وجه لاقامة الدعوى.  الأسانيد القانونية : الإدعاء المباشر هو حق المضرور من الجريمة في الجنح والمخالفات. وبشروط معينة« في رفع الدعوى الجنانية مباشرة بتكليف المتهم بالحضور أمام المحكمة الجنانية لسماع الحكم عليه بالعقوبة الجنانية وبالتعويض.  وشروط الإدعاء المباشر هي : أن يكون الإدعاء تم بمعرفة المضرور من الجريمة. وأن تكون الجريمة جنحة أو مخالفة؛ وألا يكون هناك تحقيقا لا يزال امفتوحاء وألا يكون قد صدر في الواقعة أمرا بان لا وجه لاقامة الدعوى؛ وأن تكون كل من الدعوبين الجنائية والمدنية جائزة القبول.  ومن المقرر أيضا أن الأمر بالحفظ هو إجراء إداري لا يحوز حجية؛ وبالتالي يجوز الرجوع فيه.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة

الثاني. اذا صدر أمر بحفظ الأوراق« وفي هذه الحالة يجوز الإدعاء المباشر.  الفرض الثالث؛ حالة صدور أمر بأن لا وجه لاقامة الدعوى الجنانية؛ وفي هذه الحالة يتعين على المضرور الطعن بالاستئناف في هذا الأمر

القنف في حق امرأ متزوجة بناء على شكواها. إدعى زوج المجني عليها مدنيا أمام المحكمة الجنائية طالبا التعويض عن الضرر الذي أصاب زوجته؛ فهل تحكم له المحكمة بالتعويض؟ وهل يسري الحكم الذي تنتهي اليه في حالة ما اذا طلب الزوج التعويض عن الضرر الذي أصابه من جراء إهانة زوجته؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير هذه القضية موضوع »الضرر الشخصي« كسبب لطلب التعويض أمام المحكمة الجنانية.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر أن دعوى تعويض الضرر لا تقبل إلا ممن ناله الضرر شخصياء أي أن يكون الضرر ناشنا مباشرة عن العمل الجناني )الجريمة( محل المحاكمة؛ فلا يمكن رفع الدعوى المدنية ممن لم يصبه ضررا شخصيا من الجريمة مهما كانت صلته بالمجني عليه؛ إلا أن يكون خلفا للمصاب فيستعمل حقه: كما في حالة انتقال الحق في التعويض الى الورثة.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية المذكورة على الدعوى الحالية نجد أنها تثير فرضين:  في الفرض الأولء طلب الزوج التعويض عن الضرر الذي اصاب زوجته« وهذا الطلب يكون غير مقبول أمام المحكمة الجنانية لانعدام صفته في رفعها .  وفي الفرض الثاني طلب الزوج التعويض عن الضرر الذي أصابه أو نال اشرفه من جراء الجريمة؛ وفي هذا الفرض تكون دعواه مقبولة؛ لآن الضرر الذي يستند إليه هو ضرر شخصي.    --- Page 20 --- الحق في التصدي القضية )51(  اقدمت النيابة العامة )أ( الى المحاكمة أمام

قد تبينت أن )أ( قد ارتكب جريمة أخرى هي الحريق العمد فأدانته عنها؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير هذه القضية موضوع سلطة القضاء في تحريك الدعوى الجنانية في حالات التصدي.  الأسانيد القانونية : الأصل أن الاتهام من اختصاص النيابة العامة: أما قضاء الحكم فيختص بالفصل في الدعاوى المحالة اليه. ويقتضي ذلك بالتبعية أن يد قضاء الحكم بالوقانع والأشخاص المرفوعة بها الدعوى عليهم؛ وهو ما يسمى بمبدأ بة وشخصية الدعوى. ومفاد ذلك أنه اذا تبين للمحكمة عند نظر الدعوى أن  هناك وقانع لم ترفع بها الدعوى أو أن هناك متهمين أخرين كان يجب رفع الدعوى عليهم؛ فلا تملك سوى إحالة الأوراق للنيابة العامة دون أن تتعرض المحكمة لتلك الوقانع أوهؤلاء الأشخاص.  واستثناء من ذلك أجاز قانون الإجراءات الجنائية لمحكمتي الجنايات والنقض في أحوال معينة وبشروط محدده تحريك الدعوى بالنسبة لوقائع لم ترفع عنها. وبالنسبة لمتهمين لم تقم عليهم الدعوى المنظورة أمامهاء وهو ما يطلق عليه لفظ التصدي  .ويشترط لصحة التصدي توافر الشروط الثلاثة  أن تكون المحكمة اللحكم فيها.  اتصلت بموضوع الدعوى الأصلية اتصالا صحيحا.   --- Page

الجدد حتى تنتهي منها إما بإحالة الدعوى الى محكمة أخرى للفصل فيهاء وإماا بإصدار أمر بألا وجه لاقامة الدعوى فيها.  التطبيق : بتطبيق المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية نجد أن هناك فرضين :  في الفرض الأول« يجوز لمحكمة الجنايات استعمال حق التصديء حيث تبين الها أثناء محاكمة )1( أن هناك متهما آخر ساهم معه في ارتكاب جريمة السرقة بالإكراه« ويكون ذلك بتحريك الدعوى الجنانية ضده؛ وأحالته الى النيابة العامة.  ولكن المحكمة أخطات عندما حاكمت المتهم الآخر وأدانتهء لأنه كان يتعين عليها أن تكتفي بإحالته الى النيابة العامة دون محاكمته؛ حيث لا يجوز للمحكمة الفصل فيما تصدت فيه؛ أي أنه لا يجوز لها الجمع بين صفتي الخصم والحكم في نفس الوقت.  وفي الفرض الثاني؛ لا يختلف الحكم حيث استعملت المحكمة حقها في التصدي بتحريك الدعوى الجنانية ضد )أ( عن الجريمة الأخرى.  ولكن المحكمة أخطأت عندما قضت بإدانة )أ( عن الجريمة الثانية؛ في حين أنه كان يتعين عليها إحالة الدعوى الى النيابة العامة لاتخاذ شنونها فيهاء أما بالإحالة الى محكمة أخرى للفصل فيهاء وأما بإصدار الأمر بألا وجه لاقامة الدعوى فيها.    --- Page 22

المحكمة بالعقوبة المقررة. ما رأيك في إجراءات المحاكمة؟ وهل يسري هذا الحكم لو كانت جريمة السب قد وقعت من أحد المحامين؟: أو وقعت من أحد الشهود أثناء انعقاد جلسة المحكمة المدنية؟  الإجابة المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق القضية المطروحة بموضوع جرائم الجلساء  الأسانيد القانونية : رعاية لحرمة الجلسات ومحافظة على هيبة القضاء. أعطى قانون الإجراءات الجنائية للمحاكم سلطة رفع الدعوى الجنانية بالنسبة للجرائم التي تقع في الجلسات؛ بل وأجاز للمحكمة الفصل فيها.  .ويختلف نطاق هذه السلطة تبعا لما اذا كانت المحكمة جنائية أو مدنية.  فبالنسبة لجلسات المحاكم الجنائية يفرق المشرع الإجرائي بين نوعين من الجرائم:  في النوع الأول من الجرائم وهي الجنح والمخالفات؛ تحرك المحكمة الدعوى وتحكم فيهاء وذلك بصرف النظر عن نوع الجنحة أو شخص من وقعت عليه. كما الا تتقيد المحكمة في هذه الحالة بتقديم شكوى أو طلب أو غيره من قيود رفع الدعوى الجنائية.  وفي النوع الثاني من الجرائم« وهي المعدة من الجنايات؛ تقتصر فيه سلطة. المحكمة على إصدار الأمر بتحرير محضر بالواقعة وبما ترى اتخاذه من إجراءات    --- Page 23 --- تحفظية أو القبض على المتهم إذا اقتضى الحال ذلك وإحالة الأوراق الى النيابة العامة.  ويستثنى من ذلك الجرائم التي تقع من المحامين في الجلسة أثناء بواجبهم أو بسببه. سواء كان أمام المحكمة الجناتية أو المدنية« وذلك رعاية لحق الدفاع وحرمة مهنة المحاماة. وعلى ذلك تقتصر سلطة المحكمة على إحالة الأوراق الى النيابة لتحقيق الدعوى والتصرف فيها على هدي ما يسفر عنه التحقيق.  أما بالنسبة لسلطة المحاكم المدنية في رفع الدعوى بالنسبة لجرائم الجلسات فقد قصرها المشرع على جرائم معينة وهي أن تكون من الجنح؛ وأن يقع التعدي على هيئة المحكمة أو على أحد أعضاءها أو أحد الموظفين بها )م 7١٠‎‏ مرافعات(.  التطبيق : بإنزال |: إنية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى المطروحة يتعين التمييز بين ثلاثة فروض على النحو التالي :  في الفرض الأول؛ ارتكب المتهم جريمة سب على كاتب الجلسة وهو أحد العاملين في المحكمة؛ ووقعت الجريمة أثناء انعقاد الجلسة: وأدانته المحكمة في الحالء ولذلك تكون الإجراءات التي باشرتها المحكمة صحيحة قانونا.  وفي الفرض الثاني؛ لا يجوز للمحكمة تحريك الدعوى الجنانية عن الجرائم التي تقع من المحامين في الجلسة؛ وإنما يكون لها فحسب توجيه الاتهام الى المتهم )المحامي( بارتكاب الجريمة أثناء انعقاد الجلسة؛ واتخاذ الإجراءات التحفظية ضده وإحالة الأوراق الى النيابة لاتخاذ شئونها فيها.  وفي الفرض الثالث: إذا قامت المحكمة المدنية بتحريك الدعوى ضد المتهم ومحاكمته عن جريمة سب أحد الشهود فأنها تكون قد خالفت القانون« وتكون إجراءاتها باطلة« لأن الجريمة لم تفع على هينة المحكمة أو أحد أعضانها أو العاملين

وأثناء المحاكمة توفي المجني عليه بسبب الإصابة؛ فقضت المحكمة بإدانة المتهم عن جريمة قتل خطأء فما رأيك؟  الإجابة المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق القضية موضوع البحث بموضوع حدود الدعوى أمام المحكمة الجنانية. من المقرر قانونا أن المحكمة الجنانية تتقيد بحدود الدعوى اسواء من حيث الأشخاص أو من حيث الوقانع. فلا يجوز اللمحكمة أن تحكم في واقعة غير المرفوعة بها الدعوى أمامهاء أو تجري تغييرا في. أساس الدعوى نفسه باضافة وقائع جديدة لم ترفع بها الدعوى: كما لا يجوز لها أن تحكم على غير الأشخاص المقامة عليهم الدعوى« ولو كانت تربطهم بالمتهم المرفوعة عليه الدعوى صلة مساهمة جنانية. ومع ذلك منح القانون للمحكمة سلطة واسعة في نطاق حدود الدعوى؛ تتلخص في تعديل التهمة وتغيير الوصف القانوني للفعل المسند الى المتهم. على أنه يتعين على المحكمة؛ في جميع الأحوال؛ أن تنبه المتهم الى هذا التغييرء وتمنحه أجلا التحضير دفاعه بناء على هذا الوصف والتعديل الجديد اذا طلب ذلك. التطبيق : في الدعوى الحالية قامت المحكمة بتعديل التهمة بالإضافة؛ حيث أضافت الى الواقعة المرفوعة عنها الدعوى واقعة تدخل في تكوين الركن المادي المكون للجريمة وهي النتيجة الإجرامية التي تحققت بوفاة المجني عليه بسبب ولذلك فإن حكم المحكمة يجائب الصواب؛ لأنه قد فاتها التنبيه على المتهم بالتعديل الجديد؛ ومن ثم تكون قد أخلت بحق الدفاع.

ما لم يوقف عن عمله.  ومن المقرر أيضا أن صفة مأمور الضبط القضائي مقصورة على دوائر اختصاصهم الإقليمي, وبالتالي فإنه يشترط لصحة إجراءاته أن يكون قد باشرها في حدود هذا الاختصاص.  اويتحدد الاختصاص المكاني لمأمور الضبط القضائي بمكان وقوع الجريمة؛ أو محل إقامة المتهم؛ أو مكان ضبطه.   --- Page 28 --- 00  ومن المقرر كذلك أنه إذا لم يكن مأمور الضبط مختصا وفقا لأحد المعايير السابقة فإنه يتجرد من اختصاصه؛ ويصبح مجرد رجل سلطة عامة: ويكون الإجراء الذي باشره خارج اختصاصه الإقليمي باطلا.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى المطروحة نجد أنها تثير فرضين :  في الفرض الأول؛ قام مأمور الضبط بالقبض على المتهم وحرر له محضرا بواقعة الضربء فهذا الإجراء صحيح قانوناء ولا ينال منه كون الضابط قد باشر عمله في الوقت المخصص لراحته؛ طالما أن اختصاصه لم يكن معطلا بحكم القانون. وبالتالي يكون الدفع الأول غير مقبول.  وفي الفرض الثاني؛ إذا كانت المقهى التي حدثت فيها الواقعة تدخل ضمن الاختصاص المكاني لمأمور الضبط فإن إجراءاته تكون صحيحة قانوناء ويكون الدفع المبدي من المتهم في هذا الشأن غير مقبول.  أما اذا كان المقهى يخرج عن نطاق الاختصاص المكاني لمأمور الضبط فإن إجراءاته تكون باطلة؛ ويكون الدفع المبدي من المتهم مقبولا.    --- Page 29 --- القضية )15(  بدأ )أ( في تنفيذ جريمة خطف )ب(

وقبض عليه وفتش منزله فوجد أسلحة بدون ترخيص. ما رأيك فيما. اتخذه من إجراءات؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير القضية الحالية مسألتين : الأولى تعلق بالاختصاص المكاني لمأمور الضبط القضاني وحالات امتدا الاختصاص. والثانية تتعلق بموضوع الندب وحده : من المقرر أنه يجوز لمامور الضبط القضاني أن يباشر اختصاصه المكاني في حالتين: الأولى؛ أن تكون الإجراءات متصلة بجريمة يختص هو أصلا باتخاذ الإجراءات بشأنها. والحالة الثانية هي حالة الضرور ند اختصاصه الى جميع من اشتركوا في الجريمة التي وقعت في دائرة اختصاصه.  ومن المقرر أيضا أن مأمور الضبط يتقيد بالإجراءات الواردة في أمر الندب« فلا يجوز له القيام بأعمال أخرى لم ترد صراحة في أمر الندب وإلا وقعت باطلة.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الواقعة المطروحة يتضح النا الآتي :  أن الأمر بالقبض على المتهم قد صدر من وكيل نيابة مختص ولمأمور ضبط قضاني مختصء لأن الجريمة )الخطف( وقعت في دائرة اختصاصهماء وبالتالي يكون هذا الإجراء صحيحا قانونا.  أن الأمر الصادر من النيابة بالقبض على شخص المتهم وإن كان يجيز شخص المتهم؛ إلا أنه لا يمتد الى تفتيش منزلهه وعلى ذلك يكون القبض على وقع صحيحاء أما تفتيش منزله فجاء تجاوزا للإذن ويكون الإجراء  هذا  الإجرائية حيث ب    --- Page 30 --- الاستيقاف القضية )؟( أثناء مرور الدورية الليلية بشارع الجامعة شاهدت أحد الأشخاص يسير في الطريق ويتلفت يمينا ويساراء وما أن شاهد القوة مقبلة عليه حتى أخذ في العدو فامسك به أحد رجال الشرطة وقام بتفتيشه فعثر معه على مسدس بدون ترخيص« فاصطحبه بعد ذلك الى ضابط الشرطة؛ الذي أمر بالقبض عليه؛ وأحاله الى النيابة دفع المتهم ببطلان الاجراءات: فما رأيك في هذا الدفع.  الإجابة  المسائل القانو ابين القبض والاء  الأسانيد القانونية : القبض هو إجراء تحقيق يخوله القانون أصلا للنيابة واستثناء لمامور الضبط القضاني.  التي تثيرها القضية : تعلق هذه القضية بموضوع التمبيز  أما الاستيقاف فهو إجراء استدلالي يجيزه القانون لمامور الضبط القضائي .ولغيره من رجال السلطة العامة بوصفهم من رجال الضبطية الإدارية المكلفين بمنع الجرائم والكشف عن مرتكبيهاء حيث يجوز لهؤلاء في سبيل التحري عن الجرائم اف كل من يشتبه في أمره أو يضع نفسه موضع الريب والظنون من أفراد الناس للتحقق من شخصيته ووجهته؛ ويشمل اصطحابه الى قسم الشرطة وعلى ذلك فإن الاستيقاف لا يتطلب وجود جريمة أو اتهام بهاء وبالتالي فلا يجوز قانونا تفتيش المستوقف أو المساس بحريته الشخصية.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على وقائع الدعوى الحالية انتتهي الى ما يلي :  أن مشاهدة المتهم يسير في الطريق ليلا ويلتفت يمينا ويسارا وعدوه عند رؤية الدورية الليلية« يكون قد وضع نفسه طواعية واختيارا موضع الظنون والريب؛ مما    --- Page 31 --- الحالة فإن ذلك يعتبر إجراءٌ صحيحا قانونا. قيام رجل الشرطة بتفتيش المتهم هو إجراء باطل لسببين : الأول؛ أن الاستيقاف الا يجيز قانونا تفتيش المستوقف. والثاني؛ أن رجل السلطة العامة ليس من سلطتة. إجراء التفتيش القانوني« وإن كان يجوز له إجراء التفتيش الوقاني.  ومتى كان التفتيش باطلا فإن ضبط المسدس يكون باطلا بالتبعية.  وأخيرا فإن الأمر بالقبض على المتهم يكون باطلا لاستناده الى إجراء غير اقانوني.  استوقفه رجل الشرطة وهو على هذه    --- Page 32 --- ا  احالة التلبس  القضية )85( شاهد مأمور الضبط القضائي شخصا يطعن آخر بسكين وعندما رأه حاول الهرب منه؛ فتعقبه الى داخل مسكنه؛ حيث ألقى القبض عليه ثم فتشه فوجد في استرته قطعة من مادة مخدرة فضبطهاء ثم لمح شخصا كان بالمنزل؛ وعندما رأى مأمور الضبط بدا عليه الارتباك وحاول الخروج ولكن المأمور أمسك به وفتشه فعثر في جبه على مسدس غير مرخصء فقام بضبطه والقبض على محرزه. ما هو حكم القانون في هذه الإجراءاد  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تعلق القضية بسلطة مأمور الضبط القضائي عند ضبط الجريمة في حالة تلبس.  الأسانيد القانونية : تكون الجريمة متلبسا بها بمشاهدتها حال ارتكابها أو عقب ارتكابها ببرهة يسيرة: أو اذا تبع المجني عليه أو العامة مرتكبها مع الصياح إثر وقوعهاء أو إذا وجد مرتكبها بعد وقوعها بوقت قريب حاملا آلات أو أمتعة أو أشياء أخرى يستدل منها على أنه فاعل لها أو شريك فيهاء أو إذا وجدت به بعد وقوعها علامات أو أثار تدل على أنه تدخل في ارتكابها أو شارك فيها  وقد رتب القانون بعض الأثار القانونية على التلبس الصحيح؛ حيث منح مأمور الضبط القضائي بعض أعمال التحقيق وهي القبض على المتهم وتفتيشه وضبط الأشياء المتعلقة بالجريمة؛ ولكن لا يجوز له تفتيش منزل المتهم في حالة التلبس إعمالا لحكم المحكمة الدستورية العليا سنة 4891  ومن المقرر أيضا أن دخول مأمور الضبط القضاني الى منزل المتهم بغرض القبض عليه؛ لأنه كان في حالة تلبس يجيز له تفتيش شخص المتهم فقط ولكن لا يجيز له تفتيش مسكنه أو تفتيش أي شخص موجود فيه إذا وجدت قرائن قوية على    --- Page 33 --- إخفانه شينا يفيد في كشف الحقيقة. فتفتيش منزل المتهم ومن يتواجد فيه لا يجوز إلا اتنفيذا لإذن من النيابة أو برضاء المتهم. التطبيق  بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية يتضح لنا الآتي :  أن إجراء القبض على المتهم وقع صحيحا قانوناء لأن الجريمة كانت في حالة اتلبس« علاوة على كونها من الجرائم المعاقب عليها بالحبس لمدة تزيد على ثلاثة  ولأن القانون يجيز لمأمور الضبط تفتيش المتهم حيث يجوز القبض عليه فإن ضبط المادة المخدرة يكون صحيحا قانونا.  أنه وإن كان يجوز لمأمور الضبط القضاني تتبع المتهم حتى ولو دخل منزله اللقبض عليه إلا أنه لا يجوز له تفتيش أي شخص يكون موجودا في منزل المتهمه إذا وجدت قرائن على حيازته أشياء تفيد في كشف الحقيقة.  وعلى ذلك فإن تفتيش مأمور الضبط القضاني للشخص الذي كان متواجدا في امنزل المتهم يكون قد وقع باطلاء لأنه لم يكن بمناسبة تفتيش قانوني لمنزل المتهم. وبالتالي يكون القبض على الشخص الآخر وضبط السلاح معه قد وقع باطلا.   --- Page 34 --- 80-5  القضية )41(  دخل مأمور الضبط القضاني أحد المحال العامة لمراقبة تنفيذ القوانين واللوائح بهاء فأشتم رائحة مادة مخدرة؛ فأتجه الى مصدرهاء فوجد شخصا يتعاطى المخدر ففبض عليه؛ وفتشه فوجد كمية من المخدرات في ملابسه فضبطهاء وقام بفتح درج اصغير مغلق داخل المحل؛ فوجد به نقود مزيفة فضبطهاء ولم يجد صاحب المحل موجودا وشاهد زوجته تخفي ينا في صدرها فقام بتفتيش زوجته بأن وضع يده في اصدرها فوجد كمية من المخدرء أذكر رأيك في هذه الإجراءات مع تدعيمه بالأسانيد القانونية. وهل يختلف الحكم لو تبين أن الشخص الذي كان يتعاطى المخدر هو صاحب المحل؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق القضية بموضوع سلطة مأمور الضبط القضاني عند ضبط الجريمة في حالة تلبس داخل المحال العامة.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر أن دخول مأمور الضبط القضائي المحال العامة هو إجراء إداري للكشف عن الجرائم.  ويقصد بالمحال العامة كل مكان يباح لجمهور الناس الدخول فيه بغير تمييز.  ومن المقرر أن الحصانة المقررة للمساكن لا تمتد الى غيرها من الأماكن الخاصة؛ والتي خصصت لمزاولة مهنة أو نشاط معين ولذا تستمد حرمتها من اتصالها بشخص حانزهاء فيكون مرتبطا  ومن المقرر أن دخول مأمور الضبط الى المحل العام مقيد بعدة جاوزها كان دخوله غير مشروع:؛ وما يتخذه من إجراءات يكون باطلا.  فلا يجوز لمأمور الضبط الدخول الى المحل العام إلا في الأوقات التي يجوز فيها لجمهور الناس الدخول فيه ولا يجوز له الدخول الى الأماكن التي لا يصرح  رده بحيث إذا    --- Page 35 --- اللجمهور بالدخول فيهاء ولا يجوز له أن يفتح درج مكتب فيه أو التعرض للأشياء المغلقة ما لم يدرك كنه ما فيها من مواد محظورة. التطبيق بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية ننتهي الى أن :  يعتبر القبض على الشخص الذي كان يتعاطى المخدر وتفتيشه إجراءين صحيحين قانوناء لآن مأمور الضبط القضائي قد ادرك حالة التلبس بإحدى حواسه  اوهي حاسة الشمء وصحة الإجراءات تجد سندها في حالة التلبس؛ ولم تستند الى حق مأمور الضبط في ارتياد )دخول( المحال العامة.  يعتبر فتح الدرج المغلق داخل المحل العام إجراء غير صحيح: لأن مأمور الضبط لم يدرك كنه ما فيه بإحدى حواسه وبالتالي يكون التفتيش والضبط باطلين.  وبالنسبة لتفتيش زوجة صاحب المحل فهو إجراء باطل أيضا لسببين :  الأول« لمخالفته الغرض من دخول المحل العام الذي لا يعطيه الحق في تفتيش رواده. والثاني؛ قيامه بتفتيش الأنثى بنفسه.  والحكم يختلف لو كان صاحب المحل هو الذي كان يتعاطى المخدرء لأن اضبطه على هذه الحالة يكون في حالة تلبس تعطي لمامور الضبط القضاني سلطة القبض على المتهم و: محله؛ لأن حصانة المحل مستمدة من حصانة اصاحبه أو شخص حانزه؛ فيكون تفتيشه مرتبطا بجواز تفتيش هذا الشخص.  2   --- Page 36 --- القضية )8؟(  اشاهد مأمور الضبط القضائي شخصا يحمل في يده مسدسا ويتأهب لاطلاقه في الهواء؛ فطلب منه إبراز ترخيص حمله؛ فأجاب بأن ما يحمله هو مسدس صوت لا يتطلب القانون ترخيصا لحمله؛ لم يصدق المأمور قوله فضبط المسدس« ثم فعثر في ملابسه على مادة مخدرة« فقبض عليه. ثم انتقل الى منزل المتهم لتفتيشه فعثر في أحد الأدراج على نقود مزيفة فضبطها. تبين عند التحقيق أن المسدس المضبوط هو مسدس صوتء وأنه لا جريمة في حمله. ما رأيك في الإجراءات التي اتخذها مأمور الضبط القضاني؟ دعم رأيك بالأسانيد القانونية.  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بسلطات مأمور الضبط القضاني عند ضبط الجريمة في حالة تلبس.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر أنه لا يشترط في المظاهر الخارجية المكونة اللجريمة المتلبس بها أن تكون صادقة في الدلالة على وقوع الجريمة؛ وإنما ينبغي أن تنبئ بذاتها عن ارتكاب الجريمة بصرف النظر عما ينتهي اليه التحقيق من عدم اوقوعها أو تسفر المحاكمة عن ثبوت الجريمة قبل مرتكبها.  التطبيق : بتطبيق المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على وقائع الدعوى الحالية يتضح الآتي:  أن مشاهدة مأمور الضبط القضائي للشخص وهو يتأهب لإطلاق المسدس في الهواء يعتبر حالة من حالات التلبس بارتكاب جريمة إحراز سلاح ناري بدون ترخيصء تأسيسا على كونها من المظاهر الخارجية التي تنبئ بذاتها عن وقوع جريمة إحراز سلاح بدون ترخيص.   --- Page 37 --- وأن ضبط ضابط المباحث للمسدس والقبض على صاحبه وتفتيشه تعتبر إجراءات صحيحة قانوناء لأن حالة التلبس تعطيه سلطة القبض على الشخص وتفتيشه وضبط الأشياء.  وبالتالي فإن العثور على المخدر مع الشخص يكون صحيحا لأنه مترتب على ضبطه في إحدى حالات التلبس.  ولكن تفتيش منزل المتهم والعثور على النقود المزيفة هي إجراءات غير صحيحة قانوناء لأنه لا يجوز تفتيش مسكن المتهم إلا بأمر قضاني مسبب أو برضاته؛ أما ضبطه في حالة تلبس فلا تجيز تفتيش منزله طبقا لحكم الدستورية العليا سنة 4851  وثبوت أن المسدس المضبوط هو مسدس صوت لا القانون ترخيصا الحمله لا يؤثر في صحة الإجراءات؛ لأنه لا يلزم لتوافر إحدى حالات التلبس بالجريمة أن يؤدي التحقيق الى ثبوت الجريمة قبل مرتكبها.    --- Page 38 --- 8-5  القضية )51(  ة مكافحة المخدرات أن المدعو )أ( المسجل تاجر مخدرات بالإدارة ينوي بيع كمية من الأفيون أثناء جلوسه في المقهى. توجه الضابط الى المقهى وجلس متنكرا بجواره وبعد لحظات شاهد )أ( يسلم حقيبة مغلقة الى )ب( ويتقاضى منه مبلغا من النقودء فقبض على الاثنينء وقام بتفتيش الحقيبة فوجد بها. كمية من الأفيون. توجه الضابط بعد ذلك الى منزل كل من الاثنين وفتشهما فوجد في منزل )أ( كمية من الحشيشء وعثر في منزل )ب( على سلاح بدون ترخيص.  اعترف )أ( للضابط بأنه حصل على هذه المخدرات من )ج( فتوجه الى منزل هذا الأخير للقبض عليه. وفتش المنزل فعثر على كميات من الحشيش والأفيون. وتولت النيابة التحقيق« وحضر محام وطلب الاطلاع على الأوراق قبل استجواب المتهم فرفض وكيل النيابة. اعترف المتهمون )أ( )ب(؛ )ج( بحيازة المخدرات ثم أنكروا التهمة أمام المحكمة؛ ما رأيك في الإجراءات التي تمت؟ دعم إجابتك بالأسانيد القانونية؟  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير القضية الحالية البحث في عدة .موضوعات وهي : سلطة مأمور الضبط القضائي في جمع الاستدلالات« حالة التلبس والسلطات التي تمنحها لمأمور الضبط اعتراف المتهمء ضمانات الاستجواب؛ مدى حجية اعتراف المتهم أمام سلطة التحقيق؛ العدول عن الاعتراف.  الأسانيد القانونية : الوظيفة الاساسية لمأمور الضبط القضائي هي التحري عن الجرائم ومرتكبيهاء وفي هذا السبيل يكون لمأمور الضبط أن يتخذ أي إجراء يراه مجديا في كشف الجريمة وجمع المعلومات عنهاء بشرط أن يكون هذا الإجراء مشروعاً في ذاته. ومن الإجراءات المشروعة إخفاء المأمور صفته بانتحاله صفة أخرى أو تنكره لضبط المتهم.    --- Page 39 --- واذا كان الأصل أن وظيفة مأموري الضبط القضائي هي جمع الاستدلالات إلا أن القانون منحهم استثناءة الحق في مباشرة قدر من إجراءات التحقيق في أحوال  ومن المقرر أنه يشترط لضبط الجريمة في حالة تلبس توافر شرطين : الأولء أن يكون مأمور الضبط قد تحقق من حالة التلبس بنفسه؛ والثانيء أن يتم ذلك بطريق مشروع.  ويترتب على ثبوت حالة التلبس منح مأمور الضبط القضائي سلطات واسعة في القبض على المتهمين وتفتيشهم وتفتيش الأماكن الخاصة المخصصة لغرض أخر غير السكنى. ولكن لا يجوز تفتيش منزل المتهم في حالة التلبس.  .وفي حالة التلبس يبيح لمأمور الضبط القضائي الذي تحقق منها أن يقبض على كل من يقوم دليل على مساهمته فيها.  .والاعتراف فيقصد به إقرار الشخص على نفسه بصحة ارتكابه التهمة المنسوبة. اليه. أما إقرار المتهم على متهم آخر فهو بمثابة شهادة يمكن للمحكمة التعويل 0-0  وللمحكمة أن تأخذ باعتراف المتهم متى تحفقت من توافر جميع شروط صحته ولو صدر أمام سلطة التحقيق« وحتى لو عدل عنه المتهم أمام محكمة الموضوع.  وفيما يتعلق بالاستجواب فإن المشرع أحاطه بضمانات عديدة منها: أن يباشر المحقق الاستجواب بنفسه؛ وأن يدلي المتهم بأقواله بمحض إرادته؛ وأن يحيط المحقق المتهم بحقيقة الشبهات القاتمة ضده؛ ودعوة محامي المتهم لحضور الاستجواب أو المواجهة؛ وتمكين هذا المحامي من الإطلاع على التحقيق في اليوم السابق على الاستجواب ما لم يقرر المحقق غير ذلك. وهذه القواعد الجوهرية مقررة لمصلحة الخصوم؛ فيسقط الحق في التمسك بها وبالتنازل عنها صراحة أو    --- Page 40 --- التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية يبين لنا أن:  جلوس مأمور الضبط في المقهى متنكرا حتى يتمكن من ضبط )أ( الذي دلت المعلومات على أنه ينوي بيع مخدرات هو إجراء صحيح قانونا.  أما مشاهدة الضابط ل )أ( وهو يسلم حقيبة مغلقة الى )ب( ويتسلم مبلغا من النقود لا تتوافر به حالة التلبس بإحراز مواد مخدرة« لأن مأمور الضبط لم يشاهد ما بداخل الحقيبة« وبالتالي فلم تتحقق إحدى حالات التلبس.  .ولما كانت التحريات وحدها لا تكشف عن قيام حالة التلبس؛ فإن عملية الضبط والقبض على المتهمين تكون باطلة.  .واذا انتفت حالة التلبس فإن تفتيش الحقيبة يكون باطلا لأنه إجراء مترتب على إجراءات باطلة قانونا.  وبالنسبة لانتقال الضابط الى منزل كل من )أ(« )ب( وتفتيشهما فهو إجراء اباطل؛ لأنه حتى لو كانت حالة التلبس متوافرة وصحيحة قانوناء فإنها لا تبيح المأمور الضبط القضائي تفتيش منزل المتهم أو غيره طبقا لحكم الدستورية العليا اسنة 4491  أما اعتراف المتهم على أن )ج( هو مصدر المخدرات؛ ثم توجه الضابط الى منزل هذا الأخير للقبض عليه وقيامه بتفتيش المنزل« فهي إجراءات باطلة لعدة أسياب :  السبب الأول : بطلان القبض لانتفاء حالة التلبس« مما يجعل قيام الضابط  بناء على اعتراف )أ( إجراء غير مشروع,؛ ومن ثم يكون باطلاء وذلك رغم اعتراف )أ( على )ج(. لأنه يجب أن يتأكد مامور الضبط القضائي من حالة  السبب الثاني : أن منزل )ج( وقع باطلاء لأنه لم تكن هناك حالة تلبس من ناحية« وحتى لو كانت حالة التلبس متوافرة فهي لا تجيز تفتيش السكن.    --- Page 41 --- وبالتالي يكون ما ترتب على القبض من ضبط الحشيش والأفيون باطلا قانونا.  وفيما يتعلق برفض وكيل النيابة تمكين محامي )أ( من الإطلاع على الأوراقء فهو غير جانز قانونا إلا إذا اقتضت ذلك سرية التحقيق.  وأخيراء فإن قيمة اعتراف المتهمين )أ(: )ب(؛ )ج( فهي تتوقف على مدى صلته بالإجراءات الباطلة« بحيث إذا ثبت أنه كان منبت الصلة بتلك الإجراءات فهو اعتراف صحيح قانوناء أما اذا صدر نتيجة تأثير الإجراءات الباطلة فيكون باطلا بدورة  الإذن بالتفتيش  القضية )95( أصدرت النيابة العامة إذنا لمأمور الضبط القضائي المختص بتفتيش منزل المتهم لضبط ما يحرزه أو يحوزه من أسلحة نارية بدون ترخيص. دخل مأمور الضبط منزل المتهم وفتشه فعثر على مسدس في أحد أدراج مكتبه؛ فضبطه ثم واصل التفتيش فعثر في خزانة الملابس على لفافة صغيرة وعندما فتحها وجد بها مادة مخدرة فضبطهاء ثم استمر في التفتيش فعثر على صندوق صغير فتحه فوجد به بعض الطلقات النارية فضبطها. ما رأيك في مدى صحة هذه الإجراءات« وهل يختلف الحكم لو أن الإذن كان صادرا بتفتيش منزل المتهم للبحث عن أسلحة وذخيرة غير مرخصتين؟ وهل يختلف الوضع لو أنه عثر على المادة المخدرة بعد ضبط المسدس والذخير:  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق القضية الحالية بموضوع الندب اللتحقيق) الإذن بالتفتيش(؛ والتعسف في تنفيذ الإذن.   --- Page 42 --- 5  الأسانيد القانونية : الأصل أن تباشر النيابة العامة جميع إجراءات التحقيق« ومع ذلك أجاز قانون الإجراءات الجنانية للنيابة ندب مأمور الضبط القضاني للقيام ببعض إجراءات التحقيق« وفي هذه الحالة يعتبر هذا الإجراء كما لو كان صادراً عن سلطة التحقيق نفسهاء وينتج كل أثاره القانونية.  ولكي ينتج الندب للتحقيق أثاره القانونية لابد أن تتوافر له بعض الشروط  والشروط الموضوعية هي :  أن يصدر الندب الى مأمور اضبط قضائي مختص نوعيا ومكانيا؛ ؟- أن يكون موضوع الندب إجراء أو أكثر  أن يصدر الندب من وكيل نيابة مختص؛ ؟-  والشروط الشكلية هي :  ‎-١‏ أن يكون الندب مكتوبا وسابقا على القيام بالإجراءات وله أصل في الأوراق؛ ؟- أن يكون الندب صريحا؛ ؟- أن يتضمن الندب البيانات اللازمة  ‏وينقضى الندب بتنفيذ الإجراء المنتدب له مأمور الضبط القضاني: فالإذنن الصادر بتفتيش منزل المتهم ينتهي مفعوله متى أجري التفتيشء فلا يمكن إجراء اثانيا بناء على نفس الإذن.  ‏التطبيق ‏بتطبيق المبادئ سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية ننتهي الى ما يلي :  ‏في الفرض الأول؛ يكون دخول مأمور الضبط منزل المتهم صحيحا قانوناء لأنه كان بناء على إذن من النيابة العامة.   --- Page 43 --- وضبط السلاح الناري صحيح قانوناء لأنه الإجراء الوارد في الإذن.  أما ضبط المخدر في خزانة الملابس فهو إجراء باطلء لأنه تم العثور عليه بعد إنتهاء الغرض من الإذنء ومن ثم يبطل ما يترتب عليه من أثارء وهي ضبط المخدر.  وضبط الذخيرة هو إجراء باطل أيضاء لأن الإذن كان مقصورا فقط على التفتيش لضبط السلاح الناري وقد تم ضبطه؛ ومن ثم ينتهي مفعول الإذن.  وبالنسبة للفرض الثاني؛ يكون ضبط السلاح الناري والذخيرة صحيحا قانونا الأنه جاء تنفيذا لمضمون الإذن.  كما أن ضبط المخدر جاء صحيحا أيضاء لأن البحث بالنسبة للذخيرة يقتضي فتح خزانة الملابس والصندوق الصغير.  وفيما يتعلق بالفرض الثالث؛ فإن ضبط المخدر يعتبر إجراء باطلا قانوناء لأنه قد تم ضبطه بعد استنفاد الغرض من الإذن« من ثم تكون مواصلة التفتيش بعد ذلك من قبيل التعسف في تنفيذ الإذن.   --- Page 44 --- ع  القضية )81( أسفرت تحريات مأمور الضبط القضائي عن أن شخصا يحرز مواد مخدرة فذهب الى منزله لتفتيشه بحثا عن هذه المخدرات« ولما لم يجدها فتش سيارته  الخاصة: فعثر فيها على كمية من المواد المخدرة فضبطها.  بين حكم القانون في هذه الاجراءات؟ وهل يختلف الحكم اذا كان مأمور الضبط القضائي قد تحصل على إذن بالتفتيش بعد ذلك؟ وما الحكم لو كانت النيابة العامة قد أصدرت إذنا بتفتيش المتهم ومنزله ولم يكن مأمور الضبط عالما به وقت إجراء التفتيش؟ وهل يختلف حكم تفتيش السيارة اذا لم يكن المتهم مالكا لها وإنما مجرد حائز فقط؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تثير القضية الحالية موضوعات عدب وهي : إجراء التفتيش في غير الحالات التي يقررها القانونء صدور الإذن بالتفتيا عقب إجراءه أو بدون علم المأمور به؛ ومدى جواز تفتيش السيارة الخاصة للمتهم  قانونا أنه لا يجوز لمامور الضبط القضائي تفتيش المتهم أو منزله بدون إذن من النيابة بذلك أو برضاء المتهم نفسه. أما إجراء التفتيش بناء على مجرد التحريات؛ فيعتبر إجراءً باطلاء ويبطل كل دليل يترتب عليه أو ستمد منه  ومن المقرر أيضا أن الحصول على الإذن بعد القيام بالتفتيش يبطل هذا التفتيش؛ ولا يجوز الاستناد الى الدليل المتحصل منه في إدانة المتهم. كان تفتيش الشخص أو تفتيش منزله بناء على إذن من | السيارة يكون صحيحا منتجا لآثاره؛ لأن حرمة السيارة الخاصة تستمده من اتصالها. بشخص صاحبها أو حائزها.  ابة فإن    --- Page 45 --- ومن المقرر أيضا أنه لا يلزم أن يكون الإذن في يد مأمور الضبط وقت تنفيذه بشرط ان يكون له أصل مكتوب قبل إجراء التفتيش. ويكون الإجراء صحيحا ولو كان المندوب يجهل صدور الإذن بالتفتيشء وذلك لان الإذن يبيح الإجراء المأذون به لمأمور الضبط القضائيء وأسباب الإباحة ذات طبيعة موضوعية تحدث أثرها في إباحة الفعل« سواء علم به القائم بها أو لم يعلم.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على وقائع الدعوى الحالية يتضح أن :  تفتيش المتهم ومنزله بناء على مجرد التحريات هو إجراء غير قانوني؛ وبالتالي يهدر الدليل المتحصل من هذا التفتيش. قبل الحصول على الإذن يجعل الإجراء باطلا قانونا ولا  أن إجراء /! ايعول عليه في الإدانة.  وأن إذا صدر الإذن بالتفتيش قبل إجرانه فإن التفتيش يكون صحيحا قانونا. بصرف النظر عن علم الضابط بهذا الإذن أو جهله به.  تفتيش السيارة الخاصة هو إجراء صحيح طالما كان تفتيش صاحبها أو حانزها. جائزا قانونا.   --- Page 46 --- الاستجواب القضية )4؟( اضبط مأمور الضبط القضائي متهما في حالة تلبس فاتخذ الإجراءات القانونية المقررة؛ ثم سأل المتهم عن التهمة المنسوبة إليه فانكرهاء فأحال القضية الى النيابة العامة. دفع المتهم أمام النيابة بآن مأمور الضبط القضاني قام بسؤاله تفصيليا عن التهمة الأمر الذي يعد استجوابا غير جانز له قانونا. فما رأيك في هذا الدفع؟  الا  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بموضوع الاستجواب والضمانات المقررة للمتهم عند استجوابه« ومن بينها صفة القائم بالاستجواب؛ والجهات التي يرفع أمامها ببطلان الإجراء.  الأسانيد القانونية : الاستجواب هو إجراء تحقيق تباشره النيابة العامة بقصد التثبت من شخصية المتهم ومواجهته بالتهمة المنسوبة اليه ومناقشته تفصيليا فيه ومواجهته بالأدلة القائمة ضده.  ومن المقرر أنه لا يجوز ندب مأمور الضبط القضائي لاستجواب المتهم؛ وكل اما له هو سؤال المشتبه في أمره بشرط ألا ينطوي على أي مناقشة تفصيلية عن  كما يحظر على المحكمة استجواب المتهم إلا إذا وافق هذا الأخير على اتخاذ هذا الإجراء معه.  ومن المقرر أيضا أنه لا يجوز ندب مأمور الضبط القضاني للاستجواب وإنما يعطيه القانون سؤال المتهم باعتباره من إجراءات الاستدلال.  وسؤال المتهم يعني مجرد سماع أقواله فيما هو منسوب اليه واثبات هذه الأقوال في محضر ضبط الواقعة دون مناقشته تفصيليا فيها أو مواجهته بالأدلة القائمة    --- Page 47 --- اضده. فاذا تعدى عمل المأمور حدود هذا الإجراء تحول السؤال الى استجواب المتهم يحظر على المأمور إجراءه قانونا.  التطبيق : وبإنزال المبادئ القانونية السابقة على وقانع الدعوى الحالية ننتهي الى أنه اذا تبينت المحكمة أن مأمور الضبط استجوب المتهم كان دفاع هذا الأخير مقبولاء وترتب على ذلك بطلان الاستجواب والدليل الذي أسفر عنه. أما اذا تبين من أوراق القضية أن مأمور الضبط القضائي اقتصر على سؤال المتهم عن التهمة دون استجوابه؛ فإن الإجراء يكون صحيحا قانونا وينتج أثار:   --- Page 48 --- القضية )05( أثناء محاكمة المتهم عن تهمة منسوبة اليه سألته المحكمة عن هذه التهمة فاجاب المتهم عليها وقام بسرد تفصيلات الواقعة, فحكمت المحكمة بإدائته. دفع المتهم ببطلان الحكم تأسيسا على أن المحكمة قد استجوبته وهذا محظور لأنه في غير صالحه. ما رأيك فيما قرره المتهم؟  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق هذه القضية بموضوع استجواب المحكمة للمتهم والفرق بين الاستجواب ومجرد سماع الأقوال« أو استيضاح المحكمة عن بعض النقاط من المتهم.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر أن الاستجواب إجراء محظور على محكمة الموضوع القيام به. ولكن هذا لا يمنع هذه المحكمة من استيضاح بعض النقاط المتعلقة بالتهمة؛ وذلك عن طريق استفسارها من المتهم عنها تحقيقا للعدالة. فإذا ما اتطوع المتهم - من تلقاء نفسه - وسرد تفصيلات الواقعة؛ فإن ذلك لا يعد منها استجوابا ولا مساس فيه بحق الدفاع.  التطبيق : بإنزال المبادئ سالفة الذكر على وقاتع الدعوى الحالية نجد أن ما صدر عن المحكمة هو إجراء صحيح قانوناء ودفاع المتهم في هذا الصدد غير اسديدء لأن ما صدر عن المحكمة كان من

بمعاقبته بال أشهر. طعن المحكوم عليه بالمعارضة؛ وفي الجلسة المحددة لنظر المعارضة لم يحضر المتهم؛ وأرسل وكيلا عنه. فقضت المحكمة بقبول المعارضة اشكلا وفي الموضوع بتاييد الحكم الغيابي. فما رأيك فيما قضت به المحكمة في الحكم الأول وفي حكمها في المعارضة؟ وهل يختلف الحكم إذا كانت التهمة المرفوعة عنها الدعوى هي جنحة خيانة أمانة؟  الإجابة التي تثيرها القضية : تثير هذه القضية موضوع الحكم الغيابي« والطعن فيه بالمعارضة وحالات حضور المتهم بنفسه في الجنح المعاقب عليها بالحبس الذي يوجب القانون تنفيذه فور صدور الحكم )أي حالات الحبس الوجوبي(.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر قانونا أنه يجب على المتهم الحضور بنفسه في بعض الحالات؛ كما في الاتهام بسرقة التي يعاقب عليها القانون بالحبس؛ والمتهم العائدء أو الذي لا يكون له محل إقامة ثابت في مصر. وهي الأحكام الواجبة التنفيذ ولو مع حصول استئناقها.  أما في الجنح الأخرى فيجوز للمتهم أن ينيب عنه وكيلا لتقديم دفاعه إلا إذا أمرت المحكمة بحضوره شخصيا.  ومن المقرر أيضا أنه اذا لم يحضر المتهم في اليوم المحدد في ورقة التكليف بالحضورء ولم يرسل عنه وكيلا في الحالات التي يجوز فيها ذلك؛ يجوز الحكم في غيبته بعد الاطلاع على الأوراق.    --- Page 50 --- ومن المقرر أن الحكم الغيابي يجوز الطعن فيه بطريق المعارضة من تاريخ إعلان المتهم به.  واذا حضر المعارض في الجلسة المحددة  النظر المعارضة وجب على المحكمة أن تعيد نظر الدعوى؛ ولو تغيب عن حضور الجلسات اللاحقة.  أما اذا لم يحضر المعارض في الجلسة الأولى رغم إعلانه وعدم وجود عذر  الديه تحكم المحكمة باعتبار المعارضة كان لم تكن. التطبيق  بتطبيق المبادئ سالفة الذكر على القضية الماثلة نجد أنها تثير فرضين :  في الفرض الأول يعتبر الحكم الأول صحيحا قانوناء لأنه اذا لم يحضر )أ( شخصيا فإنه يحكم عليه غيابياء لأن الدعوى الجنانية كانت مرفوعة على المتهم عن جريمة سرقة يوجب القانون تنفيذ الحكم الصادر بالحبس فيها فور صدوره.  أما بالنسبة للحكم الثاني فقد خالف القانون لأن حضور وكيل عن )أ( جلسة نظر المعارضة لا يتحقق به الحضور الذي يعتد به القانون« ومن ثم فإنه كان يتعين على المحكمة القضاء باعتبار المعارضة كأن لم تكن. أما اذا فصلت في الموضوع فإن حكمها يكون مشوبا بالخطأ في تطبيق القانون.  وفي الفرض الثانيء يختلف الحكم لأن )أ( الأمانةه وهي ليست من الجنح التي يوجب القانون حضور المتهم فيها شخصياء بل يجوز حضور وكيل عنه؛ وبالتالي فإن الحكم الذي يصدر في هذه الحالة يكون حضوريا ولا تجوز فيه المعارضة.  اتهم بارتكاب جريمة

المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية الحالية ه القضية بسلطة المحكمة عند نظر الحكم الغيابي. الأسانيد القانونية  من المقرر قانونا أن سلطة المحكمة في الفصل في المعارضة تتقيد بقاعدة مؤداها أأنه لا يجوز أن يضار الطاعن بطعنه. ولذلك فإنه اذا عارض المتهم في الحكم الصادر في الدعوى الجنانية فإنه لا يجوز للمحكمة أن تشدد العقوبة المحكوم ابهاء سواء من حيث النوع أو المدة  التطبيق بإنزال المبادئ القانونية سالفة الذكر على وقائع الدعوى الحالية يتضح أن : الحكم الصادر في المعارضة بتعديل العقوبة الى الحبس سنة مع وقف التنفيذ غير صحيح قانوناء لأن المحكمة شددت العقوبة رغم أن القاعدة الأصولية تقضي بأنه لا يجوز أن يضار المعارض بمعارضته.    --- Page 52 --- أثر الحكم في المعارضة على استئناف النيابة العامة للحكم الغيابي القضية )8م(  حكمت المحكمة الجزئية غيابيا بحبس المتهم ثلاثة أشهر في جنحة ضربء فاستأنفت النيابة العامة وعارض المتهم فيه؛ قضى في المعارضة بتعديل الحكم بحبس المتهم ثلاثة أشهر مع وقف التنفيذ فاستأنف المتهم هذا الحكم ولم تستأنفه النيابة العامة اكتفاء باستئناف الحكم الغيابيء قضت المحكمة الاستئنافية بتأييد الحكم الصادر في المعارضة بالنسبة لعقوبة الحبس وألغت وقف التنفيذء فهل أصابت المحكمة الاستننافية في حكمها أم أخطأت؟  الإجابة  المسائل القانونية التي تثيرها القضية : تتعلق القضية محل البحث بموضوع المعارضة والاستئناف كطرق عادية للطعن في الأحكام. ومصير استتناف |! اللحكم الغيابي الذي تم تعديله في المعارضة.  الأسانيد القانونية : من المقرر قانونا أن المعارضة تجوز في الأحكام الغيا؛ الصادرة في الجنح والمخالفات ما لم ينص القانون على خلاف ذلك. ومن المقرر أيضا أن المعارضة تجوز من المتهم والمسنول عن الحقوق المدنية.  ولا تجوز المعارضة من النيابة العامة لأن حضورها في الجلسة هو شرط ضروري لصحة تشكيل المحكمة؛ وبالتالي تكون الأحكام بالنسبة لها حضورية دائما.  ومن المقرر أنه يجوز للنيابة العامة استئناف الأحكام الصادرة في الجنح من أول درجة دون قيدء سواء كان الحكم حضوريا أم غيابياء وفي هذه الحالة الأخيرة. يستوي أن يكون المتهم قد عارض في الحكم الغيابي أم لم يعارض فيه.   --- Page 53 --- على أنه يجب أن نلفت النظر الى أنه اذا كان الحكم الصادر من أول درجة. غيابيا فإنه يتعين وقف نظر الاستئناف الى حين فوات مواعيد المعارضة أو الفصل فيها. لأن مصير استئناف النيابة يتوقف على الحكم الذي يصدر في المعارضة: فإذا صدر الحكم في المعارضة بتأييد الحكم الغيابي فإن استنناف النيابة يظل قائما. أما؛ اذا ألغت محكمة أول درجة الحكم الغيابي المستأنف فإن ذلك يترتب عليه بطلان الاستنناف المرفوع من النيابة العامة؛ لأنه يصبح غير ذي موضوع. فإذا حكم ببراءة المتهم أو بتخفيف العقوبة في المعارضة؛ فللنيابة أن تستانف هذا الحكمء طالما أنه قد قضى بغير  التطبيق بإنزال المبادئ القانونية والأحكام القضانية سالفة الذكر على الدعوى الحالية اننتهي الى أن : الحكم الغيابي الصادر ضد المتهم يجوز للنيابة العامة استئنافه؛ كما يجوز للمتهم المعارضة في نفس الوقت, وبالتالي يكون الاستئناف والمعارضة مقبولين.  ار في المعارضة بتعديل الحكم الغيابي يترتب عليه سقوط استنناف  وبالتسبة للحكم الصادر من محكمة الجنح المستأنفة بتاييد الحكم الصادر في المعارضة فإنه صحيح قانونا. أما إلغاء وقف التنفيذ فإنه غير صحيح لأن المحكمة يجب عليها أن تتقيد بصفة المستأئف وهو في دعوانا المتهم وحدهء وبالتالي فلا يجوز أن يضار بطعنه.  أما استنناف النيابة للحكم الغيابي فلم يعد قانما لأنه سقط بتعديله في المعارضة« فلا تستطيع المحكمة الاستئنافية الاستناد اليه في التشديد.   --- Page 54 --- سه  القضية )4م(  انحرف أشخاص سائرين ليلا عن خط سيرهم بمجرد رؤيتهم

سائرين ليلا عن خط سيرهم بمجرد ٠‎‏ فأوقفهم مأموري الضبط القضائي )أفراد الدورية(  النصوص القانونية الواجبة التطبيق تتعلق هذه القضية بالاستيقاف وشروط صحته. والاستيقاف هو إجراء يتضمن سؤال أحد الأفراد عن اسمه وعنوانه وصناعته من شخصيته. وهو يختلف عن القبض في انه لا ينطوي علي تقييد الحرية الفرد في التنقل أو الحركة. وعلي هذا النحو فهو لا يشترط ان يمارسه من خوله المشرع سلطة التحقيق. فيجوز الاستيقاف من قبل مأموري الضبط القضائي في غير أحوال التلبس« كما يحق لرجال السلطة العامة مبا: فالاستيقاف هو أصلا من إجراءات الاستدلال ويهدف الي التحري عن الجرائم وكشف مرتكبيها ويسوغه اشتباه تبرره الظروف. والاستيقاف أمر مباح لرجل السلطة العامة إذا ما وضع الشخص نفصه طواعية واختيارا موضع الريبة والظن. وكان هذا الوضع ينبئن عن ضرورة تستلزم تدخل المستوقف للتحري والكشف علي حقيقته عملا بحكم المادة 4١‎‏ من قانون الإجراءات

الاستيقاف يعد من إجراءات الاستدلال؛ لذلك فانه وحده لا يبرر تفتيش الشخص بخلاف القبض.  حيث ان هؤلاء الأشخاص قد انحرفوا عن خط سيرهم في وقت متأخر من الليل بمجرد رؤيتهم أفراد الدورية وظهروا أمامهم بمظهر الريبة؛ فان ذلك يبرر استيقاف مأموري الضبط القضائي لهم؛ بهدف التحري عن أمرهم؛ وهو إجراء لا يعد قبضاء ومن ثم فانه يكون مشروعا.  القضية )ه(  أوقف مأمور ضبط قضائي سيارة معدة للإيجار وهي سائرة في الطريق

يقبض علي المتهم ويفتشه إذا توافرت دلائل كافية علي الاتهامء وذلك في الجنايات والجنح العقاب عليها بالحبس مدة تزيد علي اثلاثة اشهر. ولقد أجاز المشرع لكل فرد شاهد الجريمة متلبسا بها ان يسلم المتهم الي اقرب رجل من رجال السلطة العامة دون احتياج إلي أمر بضبطه إذا كانت الجريمة مما يجوز فيها الحبس الاحتياطي. ولرجال السلطة العامة في الجنح المتلبس بها التي يجوز الحكم فيها بالحبس ان يحضروا المتهم ويسلموه إلي اقرب مأمور من مأموري الضبط القضائ  بتطبيق تلك المبادئ علي وقائع الدعوى يتضح ما يلي :  حيث أن_تخلي هذا الشخص عن المخدر كان طواعية واختياراء ودون إكراه من مأمور الضبط القضائي للمتهم.  وحيث ان مأمور الضبط القضائي لم يسع للبحث عن إحراز المتهم للمخدر.  وحيث ان مجرد تخوف المتهم وخ ليس من اشانه ان يمحو الأثر القانوني لقيام حالة القلبس بإحراز المخدر بعد إلقائه. ومن ثم افلا يقبل من المتهم قوله ان تخليه

الإجراء مشروعا؟ اتكر رأيك مدعما بالسند القانوني.  الإجابة أولا : وقائع القضية  تعلق هذه القضية بان مأمور الضبط القضائي رأي رجلا من عائلة متهمين مطلوب القبض عليهم في جتاية قتلء يسير في الطريق العام؛ وما ان شاهدهم هذا الرجل حتي ارتبك وجري عندما نادي عليه مأمور الضبط القضائي؛ فجري وراءه مأموري الضبط القضائي وقبضا عليه واقتاداه إلي مركز الشرطة.  اثانيا : النصوص القانونية الواجبة التطبيق  تتعلق هذه القضية بما تطلبه المشرع في المادتين 47 و57 من قانون الإجراءات الجنائية من ضرورة توافر الدلائل الكافية حتى يحق لمأمور الضبط القضائي القبض علي المتهم. ولا يشترط ان تستمد هذه الدلائل من مصدر معينء فقد

محكمة النقض أن الأعمال الإجرائية تجري علي حكم الظاهر. وهي لا تبطل من بعد نزولا علي ما ينكشف من أمر الواقع.  بتطبيق تلك المبادئ علي وقائع الدعوى يتضح أن كون هذا الشخص من عائلة المتهمين المطلوب القبض عليهم في جناية قتل« وارتباكه لما رأي رجال القوة وجريه عندما نادي عليه الضابط: ان جاز معه للضابط استيقافه؛ فانه لا يعتبر دلائل كافية علي اتهامه في جناية تبر القبض عليه.  القضية )4(  أثناء مرور سيارة

التفنيش باعتباره وسيلة للإثبات المادي تهدف الي اكتشاف أشياء خفية أشخاص هاربين من وجه العدالة؛ فقد يكون موضوعه شخصا أو مكانا أو شيئا. الذلك فهو من إجراءات التحقيق التي تنطوي علي مساس بالحرية الشخصية أو حرمة المسكنء وهو في الحالتين من الحقوق التي كفلها الدستور؛ لذلك نص المشرع علي اضمانات معينة أوجب مراعاتها حتي يوفق بين اتجاه الدستور لحماية الحقوق سالفة الذكرء ومقتضيات العدالة الجاة  فاشترط المشرع توافر قيود القبض والتفتيش المنظمة بقانون الإجراءات الجنائية واشترط ان يكون الشخص المراد تفتيشه في إحدى الحالات المبررة له؛ كان يكون متلبسا بجريمة أو صدر أذن من النيابة العامة بتفتيشه.  وقد أكدت محكمة النقض ان تفتيش الأمتعة والأشخاص الذين يدخلون الدائرة الجمركية أو يخرجون منها أو يمرون بها هو ضرب من الكشف عن أفعال التهريب    --- Page 63 --- استهدف به الشارع صالح الخزانة ويجريه عمال الجمارك وحراسها

واشتراط وجود الشخص المراد تفتيشه في إحدى الحالات المبررة له.  بتطبيق تلك المبادئ علي وقائع الدعوى يتضح أن تفتيش سيارة هذا الشخص كان داخل الدائرة الجمركية؛ وقد وقع من الموظف المختص بذلك؛ ومن ثم تتوافر فيه الشروط القانونية المبررة للتفتيش؛ وبالتالي فان العثور علي تلك المواد المخدرة تتوافر به حالة التلبس بجريمة حيازة المواد المخدرة؛ مما يبيح القبض علي هذا الشخصء ومن ثم يكون القبض عليه إجراءا مشروعا.

في جرائم الجلسات؛ كما أن للمضرور من الجريمة أو المجني عليه الحق في تحريك الدعوى الجنائية بطريق الادعاء المباشر في الجنح والمخالفات.  - لا يختلف مدلول تحريك الدعوى الجنائية عن مباشرتها )*(.  السند القانوني  فتحريك الدعوى أو رفعها يعني طرحها على القضاء للفصل فيها. كما يدخل في تحريك الدعوى تقديم النيابة محضر جمع الاستدلالات الذي حرره مأمور الضبط للحكم في الدعوى بإعلان توجهه الى المتهم.    ---

في تحريك الدعوى الجنائية: أما مباشرة الدعوى الجنائية فمن اختصاص النيابة العامة وحدهاء ولو أقيمت من غيرها. من الجهات.  5- يجوز الأي عضو نيابة مباشرة الاختصاصات الذاتية للنائب العام ):0(.  السند

الاستئناف جميع سلطات وإختصاصات النائب العام العادية والذاتية في نطاق دائرة محكمة الاستئناف؛ لأنه يعتبر نائب عام في دائرة اختصاصه الإقليمي )نقضء س ١5‎‏ ص 4/5(.  ‎-٠‏ للمحامي العام لنيابة الاستئناف جميع

بالنسبة للاختصاصات الذاتية فإن تصرف المحامي العام لنيابة الاستئناف يكون غير قابل للتعديل أو للإلغاء؛ لأنها تعتبر كما لو كانت صادرة من النائب العام نفسه؛ فلا يستطيع النائب العام إلغائها أو تعديلها

أعضاء النيابة العامة أن يحل محل الآخر فيتمم ما  بدأه من إجراءات في ذات الدعوى )0(. السند القانوني لأن النيابة العامة تتميز بعدم التجزئة؛ فكل عضو من أعضائها - في إطار كل نيابة على حده - يقوم مقام غيره ويحل محله في حدود اختصاصاته بدون تفويضء لأن كل منهم يتصرف باسم النيابة؛ وليس باسمه الشخصي : فيتلقى أحدهم البلاغ عن الجريمة« ٠‎‏ ويكمله ثالث؛ ويتولى رابع التصرف فيه ويمثل النيابة أمام /!  خامس؛ ويطعن

العام أما عندما يباشرون اختصاصاتهم بوصفهم سلطة اتهام فإنهم يباشرونها ليس باعتبارهم وكلاء عنه )0:(.    --- Page 109 --- 00  فأعضاء النيابة العامة عندما يباشرون اختصاصتهم كسلطة تحقيق فيتصرفون كأصلاء يستمدون اختصاصهم من القانون ذاته وليس من النائب العام؛ وذلك لأن أعمال التحقيق تعتبر من الأعمال القضائية البحت: فلا يصدر فيها قرار بناء على توكيلء وبالتالي لا يكون للنائب في سلطة التحقيق سوى إشراف إداري وليس قانوني؛ فلا يستطيع أن يصدر أوامر ملزمة لأعضاء الثيابة بخصوص إجراءات التحقيق وجمع الأدلة كان والاستجواب؛ وإذا تصرف العضو على خلاف ما قد يوجه إليه من النائب العام يكون تصرفه صحيحا منتجآ أثره من الناحبة القانونية وان جاز أن يستتبع المسئولية الإدارية فحسب إن كان لها محل.  إذا أمر النائب العام عضو النيابة بتفتيش منزل أحد الأشخاص فلم يمتثل وكيل. النيابة بسبب عدم وجود مبرر للتفتيش. فإن تصرفه يكون صحيحا رغم مخالفته لأوامر القائب العام.  أما عندما يعمل أعضاء النيابة كسلطة اتهام - عند التصرف في الدعوى بالحفظ أو بالإحالة - فإنهم يباشرون هذا الاختصاص كوكلاء عن أصيل هو النائب العام بمقتضى .وكالة قانونية عامة يستمدون سلطاتهم منهاء وفي حدود هذه الوكالة تكون لهم الحرية الكاملة في التصرف. فعضو النيابة عندما يتصرف في الدعوى انما يفعل ذلك بوه سلطة اتهام؛ ولذلك فهو ملزم بأوامر النائب العام في هذا الصددء وإلا كان تصرفه باطلا الخروجه عن حدود الوكالة؛ فضلاً عن تعرضه للمسئولية الإدارية.  4- لا يسأل أعضاء النيابة عن الإجراءات التى يباشرونها بخصوص الدعوى  الجنائية من تحقيق أو اتهام )/(.    --- Page 110 --- السند القانوني الايسال أعضاء النيابة عما يتخذونه من إجراءات ماسة بحرية المتهم أو حرمة  فيما لو فضي ببراءته. وذلك لأن مباشرة أعضاء النيابة لإجراءات التحقيق والاتهام تعتبر  استعمالآ لسلطة المخولة لهم بموجب القانون؛ وبالتالي فهم يتمتعون بسبب الإباحة المتعلق  بأداء الواجب واستعمال السلطة طبقأ للمادة +5 عقوبات.  ولكن يلاحظ أن مبدأ عدم مسنوز المخاصمة وللرد. قتجوز مخاصمة أعضاء النيابة في

ضدها إن هي ارتكبت جريمة الزنا )(.  السند  في  لأن هناك حكم خاص بجريمة الزناء وهو انه إذا كان الزوج قد سبق أن زنا في مسكن الزوجية فلا تسمع دعواه عليها طبقا للمادة 11 عقوبات؛ وبالثالي يسقط حقه في الشكوى آقبلها. وهذه القاعدة غريبة على التشريع الجنائي المصري الأنها تأخذ بمبدأ 'المقاصة في الأخطاء'. فكأنها تتيح للزوجة الزنا مقابل زنا زوجها السابق: وهذا لا يصح لأن الخطا ل يبرر الخطاء خاصة وان المشرع يهدف من تجريم الزنا الى حماية الأسرة من اختلاط  الأنساب.    --- Page 111 --- ‎-٠‏ حدد المشرع الجرائم التى يتوقف تحريك الدعوى الجنائية عنها على شكوى من المجني عليه على سبيل الحصر )/(. السند القانوني لأن

اعتبارات اجتماعية فيما يتعلق بجريمة الزناء فلا يجوز تحريك الدعوى ضد شريك الزوجة الزانية إلا بعد تقديم شكوى من المجني عليه ضد زوجته الزانية. وان كان هذا لا يمنع من تحريك الدعوى الجنائية على الشريك بوصفه فاعلاً أصلياً في جريمة أخرىء باعتبار أن جريمة الزنا تعتبر من حالات التعدد المعنوي. فإذا كان الشريك متزوجاً فإنه يعتبر فاعلاً أصلياً في جريمة زنا الزوج إذا تقدمت زوجته بشكوى تطلب فيها تحريك الدعوى ضده. وفي هذه الحالة يتم تحريك الدعوى ضد الزوج وشريكته في جريمة زنا الزوج. ‎-٠‏ الحق في تقديم الشكوى شخصي ينقضي بموت المجني عليه ولا ينتقل الى الورثة )/(. السند القانوني فيسقط الحق في تقديم الشكوى بوفاة المجني عليه ولو ثبت انه كان يعلم بالواقعة قبل وفاته. وكان مزمعاً تقديم الشكوى قبل الوفاة. فإذا لم يتقدم بالشكوى قبل الوفاة فلا ينتقل هذا الحق الى الورثة. أما إذا حدثت الوفاة بعد تقدي

)نقض. س 74: ص 511(. ومعنى ذلك أنه يجب تقديم الشكوى التى الجهة التى تملك تحريك الدعوى الجنائية.  فإذا قدمت الشكوى الى أي جهة لا تملك تحريك الدعوى الجنائية؛ فلا يكون للشكوى أي أثر قانوني. فلا يقوم مقام الشكوى رفع دعوى طلاق بناء على جريمة الزناء أو رفع دعوى تعويض مدنية بناء على جريمة قذف أو سب أو شكوى الى الرئيس الإداريء لأن هذه الجهات لا تملك حق تحريك الدعوى الجنائية. وبالتالي لا تكون الشكوى إليها

فاباح قانون الإجراءات لرجال السلطة العامة دخول المساكن في حالة طلب المساعدة من الداخل أو في حالة الحريق أو الغرق مثلآً )م 84   --- Page 121 --- إجراءات(. فهذا يبيح لهم إجراء  تحقيقي ولا حتى إداري.  عمل مادي بحت اقتضته حالة الضرورة: لا مبا:  كما يجوز لرجال السلطة العامة دخول المساكن لتنفيذ الأمر بالضبط والإحضار أو التتفيذ الحكم الصادر بعقوبة سالبة للحرية. وللقائم بالتتفيذ ان يجريه في أي موضع من المسكن يحتمل ان يوجد به من يراد القبض عليه. فالأمر يتعلق أذن بعمل مادي لتعقب متهم للقبض عليه؛ ومن ثم يجب أن يتقيد بالغرض منه؛ ولا يتعداه الى الإخلال بحرمة المسكن. فإذا التزم رجل السلطة العامة بالغرض من دخول المسكنء فإن دخوله يكون مشروعاء وإذا شاهد مأمور الضبط جريمة متلبس بها عرضاء فإنه تقوم حالة التلبس؛ بما اتمنحه لرجل الضبط القضائي من سلطات استثنائية؛ ليس من بينها تفتيش السكن ذاته.  4- إذا تم

الضبط القضائي. والحكمة من ذلك هي حماية القيم الأخلاقية وصيائة أعراض النساءء إذ لا يجوز لمأمور الضبط الإطلاع على عورات المرأة التى يخدش حياء ها إذا مست.  والمراد بتفتيش الأنثى بمعرفة أنثى أن يكون مكان التفتيش من المواضع الجسمانية التى لا يجوز لرجل الضبط القضائي الإطلاع عليهاء كما لو أخفت المخدر في صدرها. أماا تفتيش يد المتهمة وإخراج لفافة المخدر منها بمعرفة ضابط البوليس فهو تفتيش صحيح.    --- Page

*( ويلاحظ أن مخالفة الأحكام التعلقة بتفتيش الأنثى تستوجب بطلانا من النظام العام لا قطه رضاء المتهمة بأن يفتشها مأمور الضبط بنفسه بل ان مخالفة القائم بالتفتية جناية او جنحة بحسب الأحوال.  *5- التفتيش الوقائي هو إجراء تحقيقي يستهدف البحث عن أدلة جريمة وقعت بالفعل )(. السند القانوني.  الوقائي هو إجراء استدلالي وليس إجراء تحقيقيء وبالتالي يجوز أن يباشره مأمور الضبط القضائي ورجل السلطة العامة في حالة التحفظ على المتهم المتلبس بجريمة.  والتقتيش الوقائي يعني تحمس ملابس الشخص من الخارج لتجريده مما قد يحوزه من اسلاح أو أدوات قد يستعملها في الاعتداء على غيرهء وبالتالي فهو لا يستهدف البحث عن الأدلة في جريمة وقعت. وعلى ذلك يكون التفتيش الوقائي مشروعا طالما بقى في نطاق غرضه؛ أي اقتصر على تحري وجود الشئ الخطر. وبالتالي إذا بوشر وتبين أن المتهم ليس معه ما يخشى منه؛ فلا يصح بعد ذلك متابعة البحث في ملابسه؛ وإلا تجاوز الغرض منه وصار عملا غير مشروع؛ كما لو استهدف ضبط شئ تعد حيازته جريمة كمخدر فيقع باطلا.  4- سؤال المتهم مثل الاستجواب من إجراءات التحقيق الابتدائي )0\"(.    --- Page 124 --- لووك  السند القانوني وال المتهم عن التهمة هو إجراء استدلالي: فمقتضاه مجرد توجيه التهمة إليه إثبات أقواله بشأنها دون مناقشة فيهاء ولا مواجهة بالأدلة القائمة قبله. ولأن سؤال المتهم إجراء استدلالي؛ فيملكه عضو النيابة ومأمور الضبط القضائي وحتى رجل السلطة العامة.  كما ان سؤال المتهم كإجراء استدلالي لا يتضمن اعتداء على الحرية الشخصية اللمتهم.  أما الاستجواب: فهو يعني توجيه التهمة الى المتهم ومجابهته بالأدلة المساقة عليه دللا دليلء ومناقشته فيها تفصيلاً كي يفندها إن كان منكرآ لها أو يعترف بها إذا شاء الاعتراف.  والاستجواب من إجراءات التحقيق تتولاه النيابة العامة وقاضي التحقيق؛ ولا يجوز ندب /إمور الضبط

يحوز أي حجية.  ويصدر الأمر بالحفظ من أي عضو من أعضاء النيابة العامة؛ ويجوز له العدول عنه الأنه لا يجوز أي حجية.  والأمر بالحفظ يكون مسبوقا بإجراء استدلالي فحسب.    --- Page 125 --- والعبرة في تحديد طبيعة الأمر بالحفظ الصادر من النيابة العامة هي بحقيقة الواقعء الا بما تذكره النيابة عنه أو بالوصف الذي يوصف به. والفيصل بين المر بالحفظ والأمر بأن لاوجه لإقامة الدعوى يكمن في مباشرة التحقيق قبل هذا الأمر أو ذاك من عدمه. بمعنى انه إذا كان الأمر مسبوقا بإجراءات استدلال فهو أمر بالحفظ وإذا كان مسبوقا بتحقيق بالمعنى الفني فهو أمر ثاني لا وجه لإقامة الدعوى.  وعلى ذلك فالأمر بالحفظ كإجراء إدازي لا يجوز حجية؛ لا يكسب المتهم حقا ولا يمنع النيابة من العدول عنه في أي وقت قبل انقضاء الدعوى الجنائية بمضي المدة.  والأمر بالحفظ لا يمنع المضرور من الالتجاء الى طريق الادعاء المباشر إذا توافت اباقي شروطه.  ولا يجوز الطعن في الأمر بالحفظ أمام القضاء لا من المدعي بالحق المدني ولا من المجني عليه؛ وان كان يجوز التظلم منه لمصدره أو لرؤسائه لا »لأنه من الناحية القانونية لا يقيده  والأمر بالحفظ كإجراء إداري لا يقطع التقادم إلا إذا اتخذ في مواجهة المتهم أو إذا أخطر به يوجه رسمي.  أما الأمر بأن لاوجه لإقامة الدعوى« فهو أمر قضائي يصدر من أحد سلطات التحقيق الابتدائي لتصرف به النظر عن إقامة الدعوى أمام محكمة الموضوع؛ لسبب من الأسباب التى بينها القانون« ويحوز حجية مؤقتة. وهذا يعني أن الأمر بأن لاوجه لإقامة الدعوى لابد أن يكون مسبوقآ بإجراءات تحقيق بالمعنى الفني.  والأمر بأن لا وجه لإقامة الدعوق قد يكون صريحاً ومكتوباء وقد يكون ضمنياً يستفاد ضما من أي تصرف يترتب عليه بحكم اللزوم العقلي ذلك الأمر.   --- Page 126 --- والأمر بأن لا وجه لإقامة الدعوى كإجراء قضائي يجوز حجية وبالتالي يمنع من الاجوء الى

الخطأ : حرصت التعليمات العامة للنيابات على النص وجوب أن يحقق أعضاء العامة .بأنفسهم الحوادث الجسيمة من وقائع القتل الخطا والإصابة الخطأ - وكذلك ما يكون له من أهميه خاصة فيها كالحالة التي يتعدد منها المتوفون أو المصابون؛ والا يتوانوا عن تحقيق تلك الوقائع كلما اقتضى الامر ذلك؛ كما أن عليهم إجراء المعاينة لمكان الحادث بأنفسهم في هذا النوع من القضايا كلما وجدوا فائدة من وراء ذلك.  - وهذا ويجب أن يعني في المعاينة بوصف المكان وصفاً دقيقً ورصد الاتجاهات .والمسافات من أرفاق رسوم تخطيطة يراعى في إعدادها الوضوح والدقة ثم بيان حالة المبنى إذا كانت الواقعة مثلاً تهدم بناء أو حالة السيارات إذا كانت الواقعة تصادم مع بيان كافة الظروف والملابسات التي وقع فيها الحادث ثم بيان حالة المجني عليهم ووصف. إصاباتهم على أن يتبع ذلك ندب الطبيب الشرعي للكشف على المصابين« لمعرفة ما بهم من إصابات وسببها وكيفية حدوثهاء وفي حالة الوفاة يجب بيان صلتها بتلك الإصابات.  - هذا وينبغي دائماً الاستعانة بذوى الخبرة من المختصة كالمهندسين أو أساتذة الجامعات أو المفتش للسيارات في إجراء للسيارات في إجراء المعاينات إثباتأ للحالة أو تحقيقا لدفاع المتهمين على أن يقدموا تقارير بأرائهم؛ ويمكن دعوتهم بعد تقديمها المناقشتهم فيها إذا ما شابها أي غموض.  - ويراعي في حوادث السيارات التي ينشأ عنها وفاة شخص أو إصابته أن يد في محضر التحقيق رقم وثيقة التأمين الخاصة بالسيارات واسم ككل من المؤمن له والمؤمن من واقع البيانات الواردة في رخصتها وإخطار الأخير بالحادث: وعلى عضو النيابة استيفاء ذلك فيما معرض عليه من محاضر تتعلق بهذا الموضوع.  - هذا ولما كانت العناصر القانونية لهاتين الجريمتين هي الخطأ والنتيجة أي الوفاة أو الإصابة وعلاقة السيبية بين الخطأ والنتيجة الضارة فإنه يتعين أن يعني عضو النيابة باستظهارها فيتثئبت من نوع الخطأ بإحدى صوره المقررة في القانون وهي الرعونة ويراد بها سوء التفديرء وقد تظهر في واقعة مادية تنطوي على حقه وسوء .تصرف وعدم الاحتراز وينطوي على نشاط إيجابي يدل على عدم التبصر وعدم تدبر    --- Page 206 --- العواقب أو الإهمال وعدم الاحتياط وهي صورة يغفل الفاعل عن اتخاذ احتياط يوجبه الحذر ولو اتخذه لما وقعت النتيجة الضارة ثم عدم مراعاة القوانين أو القرارات أو اللوائح.  - ويتعين ندب الطبيب المختص على المصاب لبيان ما يوجد به من إصابات وسببها وسبب الوفاة وعلاقتها بالإصابات؛ وكل ذلك من الأمور الفنية التي لا يستطيع بدونها المحقق أن بتثبييت من توافر أركان الجريمة؛ وقد قضت محكمة النقض بأنه »يتعين على الحكم الصادر في جريمة لقتل الخطأ أن يبين إصابات المجني عليه ويودد مؤدى التقرير الطبى وأن يدلل على قيام رابطة السببية بين إصابات المجني عليه ووفاته استناداً إلى دليل فني« )!.  - هذا وإذا كانت الواقعة حدثت نتيجة تصادم سيارات فإن تحقيق عنصر الخطأ المتمثل في سرعة قيادة السيارة يكون من الأمور التي يجب أن يعني بها المحقق. ذلك زن القوانين والقرارات وإن نصت على حد للسرعة يجب عدم تجاوزه إلا أن هذا الحد ليس مطلقء بل انه مرتبط بظروف المرور وزمائه وزمانه؛ وقد قضت محكمة النقض بأن »السرعة التي تصلح أساساً للمسئولية الجنائية في جريمة القتل والإصابة الخطأ ليست لها وانما هي التي تجاوز الحد الذي يقنضه ملابسات الحال وظروف المرور نه: فيتسيب عن هذا التجاوز الموت أو الجرح« ).  حدود ثا,  وزماة  ]( نقض 1058951 مجموعة أحكام محكمة النقض رقم ؟5, ص +41. )( تقض 97/5951 أحكام التقضء س 85 رقم +5 ص 55   --- Page

الأعيرة النارية ومن كان موجود وقت إصابتك؟  ما المسافة التي أطلق منها العيار الناري؟  اس : في أي مكان من جسمك حدثت إصابتكة اس : هل تتهم أحدا بإطلاق الأعيرة النارية عليك؟. اس : هل توجد بينك وبين أحد خلافات؟ اس : هل لديك أقوال أخرى؟ - اقفل المحضر على ذلك إثبات ما تقدم الساعة ... وقررنا الأتي اثالثاً : في جريمة هتك العرض : العرض من الجرائم الهامة والني يتعين دائما العناية بتحقيقها  والمبادرة - إذا لزم الأمر - بإجراء معاينة لمكان واقعتها استكمالاً للوقوف على ظروف. الواقعة أو تحقيقً لدفاع المتهم ويكون ذلك بوصف مكان الحادث والبحث فيه عن أية آثار  تعد جريمة  اتفيد في كشف الحقيقة. كذلك اتخاذ ما يلزم من الاحتياطات للتحفظ على ملابس المجني عليهم والمتهمين في هذه الجرائم لفحص أو تحليل ما قد تحمل من أثار. أما الكشف عن .موضع الجريمة بجسم المجني عليه فقد نصت التعليمات العامة للنيابات على أنه لا يجوز العضو النيابة المحقق فحص موضع الجريمة بجسم المجني عليه في جرائم هتك العرض   --- Page 209 --- 0  ونحوهاء وإنما يندب لذلك ذوى الخبرة من الأطباء ممن تيح لهم مهنتهم مشاهدة هذه المواضع وتوضع الكشف الطبي عليهم.  - وهذا وملا كانت هذه الجريمة تشتبه أحيانً بجرعتي الاغتصاب والفعل الفاضح العلني المخل بالحياء مما يستدعي من المحقق استجلاء ماهية الأفعال المادية المرتكبة فإن الحال قد يقتضي توجيه عدد من الأسئلة الدقيقة وفي هذا المقام ننتبه إلى وجوب أن ايراعي المحقق إلا تتجاوز الأسئلة الحدود اللازمة للتععرف على مدى توافر أركان الجريمة والابتعاد عن العيارات التي تتضمن بذاتها خدشأ للحياء وتنأى يستلزمه التحقيق في هذا المجال.  - وإذن على المحقق أن يعني في تحقيقه ببيان الجزء من جسم المجني عليه الذي وقع عليه الفعل المخدش للحياء للتثبت من أنه يعد عورة ثم ماهية هذا الفعل سواء كان بالكشف عن العودة أو ملامستها أو كان على درجة من الفحش يمكن أن يعد هتك عرض .ولو كان على جزء من جسم المرء لا يعد عورة.  - هذا عن الركن المادي. أما عن القصد الجنائي فيلاحظ أن جريمة هتك العرض هي جريمة عمدية أي يلزم أن تنصرف إرادة الجاني إلى الفعل ونتيجته؛ فلا يتوافر القصد إذا حصل إذا حصل الفعل المخدش للحياء عرضاً كما إذا الأمر الفاعل عوره من جسم الغير في زحام دون أن يقصد هذه الملامسة.  - وبناء على ما تقدم فإن أهم ما يجب أن يعني به المحقق في جرب العرض استجلاء ركن القوة أو التهديد. وبالذات يجب أن يتحقق:  أولاً : أن الفعل قد وقع على المجني عليه بغير رضائه وضد إرادته فإذا تبين أنه تم برضاء وبقبول المجني عليه فلا جريمة مع مراعاة شرط السن.  اثانيا : أن يثبت أن الاعتداء كان بطريق القوة أو التهديد أو بأنه وسيلة معدمة. اللرضا أو مائعه من المقاومة كالمباغتة أو الخداع أو أثناء فقد المجني عليه لشعوره بسبب جنون أو عاهة في العقل أو غيبوبة أو النوم أو أي سبب أخر يعقد المجني عليه اختياره كالسكر أو تناول عقاقير مخدرة إلى غير ذلك.  اثالثأ : إن واقعة هتك العرض متى تعددت الأفعال المكونة لها وكانت متتابعة. .وتنفيذا لقصد واحدة كانت بغير رضاء صحيح عن كل تلك الأفعال لا ععن الفعل الأول فقط إلا إذا كان سكوت المجني عليه فيما تلا الفعل الأول هو نتيجة شل مقاومته وإعدامها.  اهتك    --- Page 210 --- هين على المحقق إلا يكتفي بما يقرره المجني عليه نفسه عن عمره أو بما يظهر من حالة نمو جسمه أو بما يورده الجاني في أقواله عن اعتباره بسن المجني عليه وإنما يتعين أن يركن في ذلك أي في إثبات سن المعتدي عليه إلى و أهل الخبرة في حالة عدم وجودها ودون الالتفات إلى مظهر المجني عليه الخارجي.  اة رسمية أواتة  محضر تحقيق في جناية اغتصاب فتح المحضر بسراي نيابة ... الساعة ‏ صر/م. انحن ... وكيل النيابة وسكرتير |! اليوم ... حيث عرض علينا المحضر رقم ...

اختلاس المال العام مراعاة لخطورة هذه الجريمة أوجبت التعليمات العامة للنيابات على أعضاء النيابة العامة أن يتولوا بأنفسهم تحقيق حوادث العدوان على المال العام بمجرد تبليفها  - ويبدأ التحقيق بإثبات ما يرد إلى النيابة من بلاغات في هذا الشأن من أية جهة. والاطلاع على ما قد يرفق بها من أوراق أو مستندات أو كشوف أو استمارات أو دفائر افإذا استلزم التحقيق فحص أعمال المتهم فيجب على النيابة أن تندب لذلك لجنة إدارية يكون أعضاؤها من غير العاملين المسنولين عن مراجعة أو مراقبة أعمال المتهم أو الذين إن له بصلة ماء ويمكن للنيابة أن تطلب رأى مدير عام التفتيش بوزارة المالية إيفاد أحد المفتشين التابعين له للاشتراك في هذه اللجنة إذا كانت هناك حاجة إلى خبرة فنية في  المحاسبة؛ وتكلف الجنة بفحص أعمال المتهم في جميع سني خدمته بالتسلسل من تاريخ اكتشاف الحادث حتى التاريخ الذي يثبت إنه بدأ فيه الاختلاس أو التلاعب سواء كان ذلك  في الجهة التي ظهر فيها الحادث أم غيرها من الجهات التي يكون قد سبق له العمل فيها.  .وللنيابة أن تطلب إلى تلك الجهات تشكيل لجان إدارته من قبلها لتتولى فحص أعمال المتهم أثناء عمله بكل منها مع مراعاة ألا تضم هذه اللجان مفتش المناطق الذين وقعت الحوادث في دائرة عملهم أو الموظفين المسئولين عن المراجعة أو الأشراف على أعمال المتهم؛ وذلك للكشف عن الوسائل التي أتبعت في ارتكاب الحادث و الأسباب التي سهلت وقوعه وعلى الأخص ما قد يتعلق منها بالقصور في أنظمة العمل أو في أجهزة المراجعة والمراقبةء وحصر جميع الأشياء والمبالغ التي وقع عليها الاختلاس أو السرقة. أو الإهمال وتحديد الأضرار التي نتجت عن الحادث مع تحديد مسئولية العاملين الذين تقع    --- Page 212 --- عليهم تبعة وقوع الحادث سواء كان هذا نتيجة إهمال منهم أو تقصير في مراجعة أعمال المتهم والأشراف عليها أو نتيجة تهاون في تفتيش أعمال المتهم ومدى مسئولية كل منهمء ثم تكلف اللجنة بتقديم تقرير بالنتيجة  - وإذا نص القانون في المادتين 711:711 على تشديد العقوبة إذا ما أرتكبت الجريمة في زمن حرب وترتب عليها الأضرار بمركز البلاد الاقتصادي أو بمصلحة آقوميه فإنه ينبغي على عضو النيابة وخاصة في حالة إذا ما نسب إلى أحد العاملين في البنوك ارتكابه أية تصرفات تثير شبهة الجريمة وأضرارها على الاقتصادي القومي الاستعانة بالبنك المركزي )إدارة الرقابه على البنوك ( بأن يطلب منها بعد فحصها لتلك التصرفات بيان ما تنطوي عليه من أضرار للمصلحة العامة والاقتصاد القومي.  - أما إذا كان البلاغ قد اقتصر على أن السرقة قد وقعت على أشياء مملوكة للدولة افي عهدة متهم فإنه يجب أن يطلب من اللجنة الإدارية جرد جميع المهمات الموجودة بالمكان الذي وقعت فيه الجريمة وحصر جميع المسروقات والكشف عن كل المسئولين عن الحادث ومدى مستوليتهم عنه وما إذا كان العجز الذي ظهر قد نشأ عن السرقة أو يرجع لأسباب أخرى.  - وهذا ويراعي ما نصت عليه التعليمات العامة للنيابات من أنه أذا استلزم التحقيق في الجرائم التي يرتكبها العاملون بجهات الحكومة أو القطاع العام وقف العامل اعن عمله فيجب على عضو التيابة المحقق ان يعرض الامر على المحامي العام الذي لله مخابرة الجهة المختصة لوقف العامل عن عمله إن رأى موجبا لذلك.    --- Page 213 --- صيغ الدعاوى الجنائية سلب الحيازة بالقوة عملا بنص

الامر الذي يقطع بعدم وجود الشيك أو المديونية كما أن البنك المطعون ضده قد انذر الطاعن بأوراق أخرى بمطالبات لا يستحقها وأقام عنها الطاعن دعوى عدم الأحقية وليس من بين الحساب. قيمة الشيك كمديونية الامر الذي يقطع بعدم وجود الشيك وبأنه مزور  اسادسا : أن حساب الطاعن لدى البنك المطعون ضده هو حساب تسهيلات انتمانية من إيداع وصرف وأن الشيك المطعون عليه ولو كان صحيحا لظهر في قيود الحساب في البنك تحت بند الحساب المدين ولما كان شيئا من ذلك لم يحدث فإن الشيك المقدم مقطوع بتزويره ومصطنع على الطاعن ردا على طلب ندب خبير لفحص الحساب. المرفوعة منه ضد البنك المطعون ضده  اجراءات تحقيق التزوير : والطاعن يطلب
